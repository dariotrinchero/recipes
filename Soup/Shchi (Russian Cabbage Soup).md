# Ingredients

## Sofrito

- 2 Tbsp unrefined sunflower (or olive) oil
- 1 Lb shredded carrots
- 2 Tbsp butter (or more oil)
- 2 yellow onions, diced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 cups diced canned tomatoes
- Salt

## Soup

- 1.25 Lb (560g) boiling potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 Lb (450g) shredded cabbage
- 25 fl. oz (740 ml) jar sauerkraut, drained, liquid reserved
- ~3L good-quality hearty stock (consider bay leaves, beef bouillon cubes, veg stock)

# Method

1. Put the oil into a large skillet and set over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the carrots and a generous pinch of salt. Stir, cover and cook until the bottom browns, 7 to 10 minutes. When the carrots are brown, give them a stir and cook uncovered until completely tender, 2-5 min. Get the carrots out of the pan and add the butter or more oil, the onions, salt, and do the same thing we did with the carrots. Cover until the onions start to get tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Uncover and cook until they are translucent and golden brown, about 10 min. Return the carrots back to the pan. Add the garlic and cook on moderate heat until it gets aromatic, 2-5 min. Add the tomatoes and cook until all the moisture evaporates. When it looks nice and thick, taste and adjust for salt.
2. De-grease your stock. Pour it into an 8 quart pot and bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust for salt. Add the potatoes and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Add the cabbage, drained sauerkraut, and another quart of water. Simmer very gently until the cabbage is almost tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the sofrito, taste and add the sauerkraut brine to taste depending on how salty and acidic you want the soup to be. Simmer for 15 min. Take off heat and let rest at least 30 min. Serve with sour cream.
