# Ingredients

- 2 large carrots, peeled & cubed
- 1/2 large butternut, peeled & cubed
- 1 sachet dried onion soup powder
- 1 tin of tomatoes
- 3 sticks of celery with leaves, sliced
- 1 pack of parsley, chopped
- 2 tubs of Knorr veg stock (or other stock to taste)
- 1/3+ cup each of split peas & orange lentils
- 1 large onion, roughly chopped
- Salt & pepper

# Method

1. Chuck everything in a pot with a good amount of water; boil (partially covered) until flavour is infused & veg is tender. Stir occasionally to prevent the pulses from sticking to the bottom.

# Notes

- Ina Paarman's onion soup powder is at least explicitly vegan, while Knorr's is not. Maybe just add some MSG if using the former.
