# Ingredients

- 2 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic crushed
- 1 onion large, finely diced
- 16 oz portobello mushrooms thinly sliced
- 5 cups vegetable broth
- 2 (15-oz) cans cannellini beans rinsed and drained
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon of dried thyme
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes

# Method

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot. Add garlic and cook on medium heat for 1 minute.
2. Discard garlic and add onion to the same pot. Sauté for 7 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook for 7-10 minutes until all liquid evaporates.
3. Add 4 cups of broth, beans, thyme, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium low and cook soup for 15 minutes.
4. Remove the thyme from the pot. Take 1-2 ladles full from the pot and puree in a blender.
5. Transfer pureed soup back into the pot and adjust the seasoning if needed. If the soup is too thick, add another 1 cup of broth and bring soup to a boil, then remove from the heat.
