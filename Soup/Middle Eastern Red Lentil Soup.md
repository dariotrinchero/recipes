# Ingredients

- 250g (1/2 lb) Red Lentils
- 150g (5 1/4 oz) Carrots
- 1 Brown Onion
- 1 Tomato 
- 4-6 Garlic Cloves
- 1/2 Cup Vermicelli
- 3 Tbsp White Vinegar
- 1 1/2 Tbsp Olive Oil
- 1 1/2 Tsp Salt 
- 1 1/2 Tsp Cumin
- 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper
- 1/4 Tsp Chilli

# Method

 1. Peel and slice your carrot into large chunks. Slice both your onion and tomato into quarters. Peel your garlic cloves, mince 2 of them and set aside. Add your chopped vegetables, the lentils and garlic (the whole ones not minced) to a large pot.
 2. Add 1.25 litres (quarts) of stock or water to the pot and 1 teaspoon cumin, turn the heat up to high and boil the pot.
 3. When it boils, pull out your tomato quarters and remove their skin, then add them back to the pot. Turn the heat down to low and allow the soup to simmer for 45 minutes.
 4. When done simmering, the carrots should be cooked through, use an immersion blender to turn the soup into a smooth mixture. Be sure to blend all the vegetable pieces and it should be uniformly smooth.
 5. **Key step**: In a small pot add 1/2 a tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat and add the minced garlic to it. Fry for about 30 seconds then add the remaining cumin. Fry for another 10-15 seconds then add the vinegar. Mix and fry for 15 more seconds and add it to the lentil soup.
 6. Mix in well then add salt, pepper and chilli powder (optional)
 7. In a pot add the remaining olive oil and the vermicelli and fry on medium high heat until it turns a golden color. Add the fried vermicelli to the soup as well as about 1 cup of water, bring the pot to a boil once more and allow the vermicelli to cook for 10 minutes.
 8. When the time is up, your soup is ready, add more water if necessary to thin it out until it's a smooth liquid.
 9. Garnish with coriander, chilli and nigella seeds
