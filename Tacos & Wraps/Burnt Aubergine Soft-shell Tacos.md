# Method (parallelisable)

1. Remove the aubergine leaves & place whole on hot cast iron skillet. Rotate to blacken all 4 sides. Donâ€™t worry about going too long.
2. For butter bean mash, mix all listed ingredients & mash together. Adjust to taste.
3. Make caramelised onions as per [Hellen Rennie](https://youtu.be/kEfJTmf9hDs). Deglaze at the end with balsamic vinegar.
4. Make crispy chickpeas as per [Internet Shaquille](https://youtu.be/5EU76q3Vf3Q) (microwave until dry, then pan fry until crispy). Salt while hot.
5. Make gremolata as per [this recipe](https://www.feastingathome.com/gremolata-recipe/) (chop parsley & mix all listed ingredients). Adjust to taste.
6. For the tacos, mix ingredients, & kneed for ~5min. Rest covered in fridge for ~30min to relax. Divide into 9 equal pieces by mass. Roll each portion into a circle, then lightly toast on each side in a piping hot cast iron (small bubbles should form). As the tacos come off the heat, stack them to keep them warm.
7. Assemble the tacos, finishing each with a generous squirt of lime juice.

# Notes

- Definitely parallelise the method. For instance, blacken aubergines while caramelising onions.
