# Ingredients

- 200ml brown basmati rice
- 40g mixed herbs (20g fresh coriander & 20g fresh mint)
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 whole onion, chopped
- 2 fresh chillies, roughly sliced
- 125g+ button mushrooms, roughly sliced
- 120g lentils
- 20ml spice blend (Indian rub + garam masala)
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 4 cardamom pods
- 1.5 tsp whole cumin
- 200g+ baby marrow, sliced
- 120ml+ yogurt
- oil for frying
- salt & pepper
- lemon juice to serve

# Method

1. Cook the rice and the lentils. The lentils should still be intact. Drain the lentils.
2. Rinse, pick, & finely chop the herbs. In a pestle & mortar, combine the chopped coriander, 1/2 of the chopped mint, 3/4 of the sliced chilli, and a drizzle of olive oil, to create a chunky paste.
3. Heat some oil in a large pot. Add the sliced mushrooms and the lentils, and fry until softened and browned.
4. Add the garlic, then the spice mix, and finally the diced onion and whole spices. Saute until the onion is soft.
5. Add the coriander-mint paste and salt. Fry until fragrant.
6. Add the baby marrow, and fry until soft.
7. Add the cooked rice to the pot of lentils, and gently toss together. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside to dry for about 10min.
8. In a bowl, combine the yogurt, the remaining mint, and seasoning. Serve with a squeeze of lemon.

# Notes

- Adding the onion & baby marrow late to the pot does make them fry less, but it this is a good thing; the final dish tastes more fresh with less-cooked vegetables.
