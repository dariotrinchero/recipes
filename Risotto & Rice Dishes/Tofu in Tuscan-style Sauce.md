# Ingredients

-  1 (14 oz) block extra-firm tofu, drained and pressed; consider also [[Lentil Tofu]]
-  salt and pepper
-  1/3 cup flour
-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-  2 tablespoons vegan butter
-  1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
-  1 small yellow onion (or 2 shallots), finely diced
-  2-4 cloves garlic, minced
-  1 cup chicken-style vegetable broth
-  1 cup cashew cream (recipe follows) or vegan heavy cream alternative
-  1/3 cup grated vegan Parmesan
-  1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
-  1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
-  1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
-  2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped

## Cashew Cream

- 1/2 cup raw cashews soaked 4+ hours
- 2/3 cup water

# Method

#### Prepare the tofu

1. Drain the tofu. You can press the tofu ahead of time using your own favourite method, and then slice into 6 "steaks," each roughly 1/2" thick. OR, follow the next step to quick-press.
2. To quick-press the tofu: Slice into 6 "steaks," each roughly 1/2" thick. Arrange on one side of a clean, lint-free kitchen towel. Fold the other half of the towel over the top and weigh down gently with something flat (like a cutting board or baking sheet). Press for 15-20 minutes.
3. Generously salt and pepper the pressed tofu steaks on both sides. Add flour to a plate or shallow dish. Dredge the pressed tofu slices in the flour.
4. In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat olive oil and vegan butter. Swirl the pan to evenly coat with the oil.
5. Add the dredged tofu slices in one layer (work in batches if needed). The tofu should sizzle immediately when added to the pan; otherwise, the oil isn't hot enough. Pan-fry until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side. Once the tofu is golden brown on both sides, remove it to a plate.

#### Prepare the sauce

1. Add onion, garlic, and optional red pepper flakes to the pan and sauté for 3-5 minutes, until onion is translucent.
2. Deglaze the pan with the veggie broth. (Or you can deglaze with a splash of dry white wine; then add the veggie broth after about 1 minute.) Scrape up any flour or browned bits from the bottom of the pan with your spoon.
3. Add the cashew cream, vegan Parmesan, oregano, thyme, sun-dried tomatoes. Reduce the heat to low once the mixture reaches a simmer, and stir until the Parmesan is melted. If the sauce thickens more than you like, simply add in a splash of water or veggie broth to thin it back out to your preferred consistency.
4. Give the sauce and a taste and season to preference with salt and fresh cracked black pepper. The amount of salt needed will vary depending on the sodium content of your veggie broth.
5. Add the cooked tofu back into the pan and allow it to simmer for another minute or two to reheat the tofu.
6. Serve garnished with fresh basil. Pair with pasta or rice for a satisfying meal.

# Notes

- **No Cashews**: You can replace the cashews with raw sunflower seeds to make homemade sunflower cream. It doesn’t have as neutral a flavour as cashews but it’s very creamy. Alternatively, you can use your favourite plant-based half & half or heavy cream substitute
