# Ingredients

- 2 litres vegetable stock
- 1 large leek, trimmed and washed, green and white parts separated
- 6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve
- 200g prepared spring greens (spinach, kale, etc)
- 1 x 28g pack flat-leaf parsley, stalks and leaves separated and chopped
- 100g baby leaf spinach
- 2-3 garlic cloves, crushed
- zest and juice of 2 small lemons
- 300g carnaroli or other risotto rice
- 60g grated Parmesan or vegetarian hard cheese, plus extra to serve (substitute for nutritional yeast and optional splash of coconut cream)

# Method

1. Bring the stock to the boil in a large pan with the lid on. Finely slice the white part of the leek. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wide heavy-based pan and add the white leek. Cook over a medium-low heat for 5-7 minutes until softened.
2. Meanwhile, roughly chop the green part of the leek, then add to the bubbling stock with half the spring greens and the parsley stalks. Boil, covered, for 5 minutes and then add half the parsley leaves and all of the spinach leaves. Bubble for 1 minute then use a slotted spoon to transfer the greens to a food processor (keeping the stock simmering gently, covered, for the risotto). Season, add the garlic, most of the lemon zest and the remaining oil, whizzing until smooth to make a pesto-like sauce – add some stock if needed.
3. Turn up the heat, add the rice to the leeks and cook for 1 minute, before adding the juice of 1½ lemons. Add 2 ladlefuls of the hot stock. Reduce to a simmer, stirring occasionally, only adding more stock once the rest has been absorbed. Cook until the rice has softened, making sure it has plenty of bite (about 16-18 minutes); you may not need all the stock.
4. Mix in the green purée and remaining spring greens and cook for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat, then mix in the cheese, loosely cover and rest for about 5 minutes before serving; taste and see if it needs the rest of the lemon juice and adjust the consistency as needed; if it’s too dry add a splash more stock or water. Season to taste and divide between 4 bowls, drizzle with a little oil and top with the reserved lemon zest and parsley.
