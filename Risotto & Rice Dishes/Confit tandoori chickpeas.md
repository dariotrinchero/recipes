# Ingredients

- 2 tins of chickpeas (800g), drained (480g)
- 11 garlic cloves, peeled,10 left whole and 1 crushed
- 30g fresh ginger, peeled and julienned
- 400g datterini or regular cherry tomatoes
- 3 red chillies, mild or spicy, a slit cut down their length
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed with a pestle and mortar
- 2 tsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed with a pestle and mortar
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
- 2 tsp red Kashmiri chilli powder
- 1 tsp caster sugar
- 200ml olive oil
- 180g Greek-style yogurt (or vegan alternative)
- 15g picked mint leaves
- 30g fresh coriander, roughly chopped
- 2–3 limes: juiced to get 1 tbsp and the rest cut into wedges to serve
- salt

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 150°C fan.
2. Put the chickpeas, whole garlic cloves, ginger, tomatoes, chillies, tomato paste, spices, sugar, oil and 1 teaspoon of salt into a large sauté pan, for which you have a lid, and mix everything together to combine. Cover with the lid, transfer to the oven and cook for 75 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the aromatics have softened and the tomatoes have nicely broken down.
3. Meanwhile, put the yoghurt, mint, fresh coriander, lime juice, crushed garlic and 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt into a food processor and blitz until smooth and the herbs are finely chopped.
4. Serve the chickpeas directly from the pan, with the yoghurt and lime wedges alongside.
