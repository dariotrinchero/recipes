# Ingredients

- 3 large potatoes
- 1 small egg
- ~1 cup flour
- generous salt & pepper

# Method

1. Poke potatoes with fork, then microwave until soft.
2. With oven gloves, grate potatoes (skin on) on large side of box grater, directly onto the counter, while still hot. Discard skin shreds. Spread out, & allow steam to escape.
3. Once cooled, crack egg into well in potatoes. Add salt, pepper, and **up to** 1 cup of flour (add flour gradually, just to the point at which dough seems capable of being rolled & shaped). Avoid kneading excessively, but don't worry too much - a little chew is nice anyway.
4. Roll into 4 logs, and cut into equal pieces. Optionally impression each with grooves using tines of a fork.
5. Cook gnocchi in gently boiling water until each piece floats.
6. Finish with sauce of your choice.
