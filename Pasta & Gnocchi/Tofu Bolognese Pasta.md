# Ingredients

- 450g (2 large blocks) extra firm tofu
- 1 large white onion, diced fine
- 2 carrots, diced fine
- 2 sticks of celery, diced fine
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 sachets tomato paste
- 1 tin of whole tomatoes
- soy sauce
- dried pasta of choice

# Method

1. Crumble the tofu into a bowl and microwave for ~3min to let off excess water; drain.
2. Fry tofu for a while to drive off remaining moisture. Break into mince-sized pieces with a spatula. Sprinkle with some MSG, but leave off salt.
3. Slowly drizzle soy sauce, little bits at a time into the tofu. This is important because the Maillard reaction requires protein (in the tofu), but also fat (the frying oil will suffice), and, crucially, **sugar** (the soy sauce provides this). After each drizzle of soy sauce, allow some browning to occur before adding more.
4. Set aside the tofu once it is a nice uniform brown.
5. Fry the *mirepoix* vegetables *sofrito*-style â€” ie. sweat on low heat for a long time until reduced and fully translucent.
6. Add garlic and turn heat to high. After frying for a bit, add tomato paste, then tinned tomato and water. Taste for seasoning.
7. Finally, we will cook the pasta in the sauce in the manner of a risotto. Add the pasta directly to the pot, along with the minced tofu, and allow to reach a simmer. Add extra water if needed.
8. Simmer the pasta for about half the cooking time, then constantly stir for the second half. The sauce should be glossy and emulsified.

# Notes

- The tofu-browning technique is worth remembering:
  
>   The Maillard reaction requires **protein** (in the tofu), but also **fat** (frying oil will suffice), and, crucially, **sugar** (soy sauce can provide this).

- This is a very simple pasta, but surprisingly tasty.
