# Ingredients

- 800g zucchini, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1Tbsp miso paste
- Olive oil
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Nutritional yeast to taste
- Pasta of choice (farfalle works well)

## Garnish

- Fresh thyme (other fresh herbs could also work)
- Toasted pumpkin seeds

# Method

1. Cook zucchini in a generous amount of oil with salt on medium, then low, for a long time (maybe 1â€”1.5h), until thoroughly caramelised (darkened). Stir from time to time to prevent burning and dislodge fond. At some point, the zucchini will begin to fall apart; at this point, mash it lightly with a spatula.
2. Towards the end of the zucchini cooking process, stir in the miso and garlic. Taste for salt & pepper.
3. Cook pasta & emulsify with zucchini paste using excess pasta water. Add nutritional yeast to taste.
4. Serve with garnish.

# Notes

- This caramelised zucchini also would make an excellent condiment.
