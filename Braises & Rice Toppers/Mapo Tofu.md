# Ingredients

- ~220g shiitake mushrooms
- 2 cups water
- ~425g block of soft tofu (do not use silken)
- Salt
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 small dried hot red peppers
- 1 tablespoon fermented black beans, rinsed (*lao gan ma*)
- 1 tablespoon fermented spicy broad bean paste (*doubanjiang*)
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon finely ground Sichuan pepper
- 1 tablespoon corn- or potato starch, dissolved in 3 tablespoons cold water
- ½ cup slivered scallions, both white and green parts
- Cilantro sprigs, for garnish

# Method

1. Remove stems from mushrooms. Make a light mushroom broth by simmering stems in 2 cups water for 15 minutes, then strain and reserve broth (discard stems). Dice mushroom caps and set aside.
2. Cut tofu into 1-inch cubes. Cover with boiling salted water, let steep for 15 minutes, then drain.
3. Put oil in a wok or wide skillet over medium heat. Add red peppers, black beans and bean paste and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic and ginger and let sizzle, then add mushrooms, soy sauce, sesame oil and Sichuan pepper. Add 1½ cups mushroom broth and cook mixture gently for 2 minutes.
4. Carefully add tofu cubes. Shake pan to distribute sauce, using a wooden spoon to help. Try to avoid smashing tofu. Drizzle in cornstarch mixture, gently swirling pan to incorporate (sauce will thicken) and simmer tofu in sauce for 2 minutes more. Thin with a little mushroom broth if necessary. Transfer to a low bowl or platter. Sprinkle with scallions and cilantro sprigs.
