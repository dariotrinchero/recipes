# Ingredients

- 12-14 small potatoes (or 6-8 large ones)
- 1 tbsp salt (for boiling)
- 30g / 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 3/4 tsp salt (for sprinkling)
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- Finely chopped parsley , optional garnish

# Method

1. **Cook potatoes:** Bring a pot of water to the boil, add 1 tbsp salt. Cook potatoes until soft - small ones should take around 20 to 25 minutes, medium ones might take 30 minutes. It's ok if the skin splits. Alternatively, steam or microwave them.
2. **Preheat oven** to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan).
3. **Steam dry:** Drain the potatoes and let them dry in the colander for 5 minutes or so.
4. **Smash!** Place on the tray then use a large fork or potato masher to squish them, keeping them in one piece. Thin = crisper. Thicker = fluffier insides. (Both good!) More nubbly surface = better crunch!
5. **Steam dry again:** Leave on the tray to steam dry for 5 minutes or so - makes them crispier!
6. **Drizzle:** Drizzle with butter, then olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
7. **Bake:** Bake for 45 minutes (small potatoes) to 55 minutes (medium) or until deep golden and crispy. Do not flip!
8. **Serve** hot, sprinkled with parsley if desired.
