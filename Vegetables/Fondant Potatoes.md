# Ingredients

- 4 x 400g large floury potatoes
- 3/4 tsp cooking salt / kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tbsp / 50g unsalted butter , cut into 1cm cubes
- 6+ thyme sprigs (sub 1/2 tsp dried thyme)
- 1 cup vegetable stock

# Method

1. **Preheat** oven to 200°C (180°C fan-forced).
2. **Carve** each potato into cylinders ~6cm diameter, 3.5cm height. One can be more or less precise about this, depending on desired presentation.
3. **Season –** Pat potato dry. Place in a large bowl and toss with half the oil plus all the salt and pepper.
4. **Sear –** In an ovenproof heavy based skillet, heat the remaining 1 tbsp oil over medium high heat. Put the potato in and cook each side for 6 – 8 minutes or until golden.
5. **Cook –** Add butter and thyme. Once melted, spoon the butter over the potato ("basting"). Add stock, bring to a boil then transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes until the potatoes are tender, basting at the 15 minute mark. The stock will be absorbed by the potato, leaving just butter.
