# Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon salt
- 4 large green bell peppers - tops, seeds, and membranes removed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 2 cups cooked rice
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chili-style diced tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Add green bell peppers and cook until slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes.
3. Drain bell peppers and arrange cut-side up in a 9x9-inch baking dish.
4. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Transfer cooked onion into a large bowl; add rice, black beans, and tomatoes. Stir in chili powder, garlic salt, cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until well combined. Fold in 1 1/2 cups Mexican cheese blend.
6. Spoon rice mixture evenly into bell peppers; sprinkle with remaining Mexican cheese blend.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
