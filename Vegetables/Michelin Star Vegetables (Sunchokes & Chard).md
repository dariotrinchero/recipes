# Ingredients

- 2 Lb sunchokes
- 1 Lb Swiss Chard, stems and leaves separated
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ½ cup heavy cream or as needed
- ½ cup water or as needed
- ½ tsp lemon juice or pomegranate molasses
- 2 Tbsp salted sunflower seeds

## Dressing

- 1 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp pomegranate molasses (or ½ tsp balsamic vinegar)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil

# Method

1. Trim and wash the sunchokes and the chard as shown in the video. Dry well. 
2. Preheat the oven to 425F (220C) and put the oven rack in the bottom third of the oven. Slice the chard stems and place on one half of the baking sheet, cut the sunchokes into bite size pieces and arrange on the other half of the baking sheet. The baking sheet needs to be big enough for all the veggies to be in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, drizzle with ¼ cup olive oil (or as much as needed to keep everything well lubricated). Mix the veggies to distribute the salt and oil and flip the sunchokes flat side down. Place in the oven until tender and brown, 20-30 min. If they are tender but not brown, turn up the heat and turn on the convection fan. If they brown, but not tender, turn down the heat.
3. Chop the chard leaves into small pieces. To make the dressing, combine the lemon juice, the mustard, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl and whisk until the mustard dissolves. Whisk in the molasses. Gradually whisk in the oil. Pour the dressing over the chard leaves and toss. Taste and correct for salt. It’s best to dress the leaves 30 minutes before serving. They can wait in the fridge for several hours and even overnight. 
4. When the chard stems and sunchokes are tender and brown, remove all the stems and ⅓ of the sunchokes from the baking sheet and set aside (we’ll add them to the salad before serving). Cool the remaining sunchokes slightly and puree them with cream, water, ½ tsp of lemon juice or pomegranate molasses, and salt to taste. Your cream and water should only cover roughly ⅔ of the sunchokes, so adjust the amount as needed. The puree can be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days and reheated gently before serving. For a salad, I like to serve it warm. For main dishes, I like to serve it hot.
5. Add the reserved chard stems, sunchokes, and sunflower seeds to the salad and mix well. Spread the puree on plates and top with the salad.
