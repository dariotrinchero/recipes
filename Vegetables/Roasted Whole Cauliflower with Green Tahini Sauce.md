# Ingredients

- 1 jumbo cauliflower, with all leaves intact (2¾ lb)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- rounded ¼ cup tahini
- ¾ cup parsley, roughly chopped
- 1 small garlic clove, crushed
- ⅓ cup water
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- flaked sea salt
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges
- pita, for serving (optional)

# Method

1. Using a pair of scissors, lightly trim the leaves at the top of the cauliflower, so that about 2 inches of the actual cauliflower head is exposed. (Note: This step is often unnecessary with grocery store-bought cauliflower.)
2. Fill a pan (that is large enough to fit the cauliflower in) three-quarters full of salted water. Bring to a boil, then carefully lower in the cauliflower, exposed head down— don’t worry if the base is sticking out a little. Return to a boil, cook for 6 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to transfer the cauliflower into a colander, exposed head down. Set aside for 10 minutes to drain and cool.
3. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
4. Mix together the butter and oil. Place the cauliflower on a medium baking sheet, exposed head now facing upwards, and spread the butter-oil mixture all over the cauliflower, followed by 1¼ tsp of flaked salt. Place in the oven and roast for 1½-2 hours, basting the cauliflower with the oil five or six times during cooking, until the cauliflower is really tender and dark golden brown and the leaves are crisp and charred.
5. Meanwhile, prepare the Green Tahini Sauce. Pour the tahini into the small bowl of a food processor along with the parsley and garlic. Blitz for about 1 minute, until the tahini is green, then pour in the water and lemon juice and season with ¼ tsp of flaked salt. Continue to blitz until you have a smooth green sauce with the consistency of heavy cream. Add a touch more tahini if it’s too thin, or a splash more water if it’s too thick.
6. Remove the cauliflower from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes, then cut into wedges (or pull it apart with your hands!). Sprinkle with salt and serve with lemon wedges, green tahini sauce and warm pita, if you like.
