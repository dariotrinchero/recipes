# Ingredients

## For the pastry

- 225g (8oz) plain flour
- 100g (3½ oz) butter
- 1 egg
- A little milk to bind, if needed
- Egg wash, to glaze

## For the filling

- 2tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 onion, sliced
- 500g (1lb 2oz) button mushrooms, halved
- 1tbsp tomato purée
- 1tbsp soy sauce
- 1tbsp green peppercorns in brine, drained
- 250ml (9fl oz) vegetable stock
- 200g (7oz) Stilton cheese

# Method

1. For the pastry, pulse the ingredients together to form a dough, adding a little milk if needed. Wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.
2. To make the filling, start by heating the oil in a large pan and fry the onion and mushrooms until soft.
3. Add the tomato purée and cook for 5 minutes, then add the soy sauce, peppercorns and stock, bring to the boil, then reduce heat slightly and cook until the liquid has reduced by half. Season to taste.
4. Divide the mixture between four individual pie dishes. Crumble the Stilton and divide that between the dishes too.
5. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan, Gas 6). Cut the pastry into four pieces and roll into four circles, just bigger than the dishes.
6. Damp the rim of the dishes with water and cover the pie dishes with pastry, trim the edges and cut a little hole in the top. Brush all over with beaten egg to glaze.
7. Bake the pies for about 20 minutes until crisp and golden.
