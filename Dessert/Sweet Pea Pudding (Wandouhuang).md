# Ingredients

- Yellow or Green Split Peas 300g (1½ Cups)
- Water (Into Pressure Cooker) 570g (2¼ Cups)
- Water (Into Blender) 60g (¼ Cup)
- Soda Ash 1g (⅛ Tsp)
- Sugar 90g (less Than ½ Cup）

# Method

2. Remove any impurities from the split peas, then rinse. Place into a pressure cooker with soda ash and water. Cook for 15min. Allow the steam to release for 10min.
3. Add to blender with remaining water. Let the water level reach 700ml. Blend until smooth and creamy.
4. Add paste to a non-stick pan / wok. Add sugar. Stir fry for a few minutes on medium-high heat, until a spatula dragged through the mixture leaves a clear line, but the mixture still freely drips and forms a pile.
5. Pour into a container. Flatten the top. If the surface flattens by itself, the mixture has too much moisture, and should be fried for longer. Bang on the table a few times. Seal with tight-fitting plastic wrap to avoid a cracked surface.
6. Refrigerate for 4h or overnight.
7. Finally, invert and tap to release from container, then cut into squares with a sharp knife. Wipe the blade clean after each cut.
