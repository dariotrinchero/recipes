# Ingredients

- 42g all purpose flour for toasting
- ~230g all purpose flour
- 50g almond flour, dry toasted to light brown
- 2/3 cup (any) oil
- 150g dark brown sugar
- 100g (normal) sugar
- 1Tbsp vanilla essence / extract
- large (4 finger) pinch of salt
- 1tsp baking powder
- 1tsp bicarbonate of soda
- ~120g dark vegan chocolate, roughly chopped
- handful cocoa nibs
- ~6tsp instant coffee, dissolved in 1/3 cup hot water, then cooled
- coarse salt

# Method

1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C.
2. Brown the 42g flour in half (1/3 cup) the oil; aim for colour of caramel. Allow to cool.
3. Whisk in: both sugars, vanilla, remaining oil, brewed coffee.
4. Add remaining ingredients, except cocoa nibs & chocolate. Lightly fold until almost incorporated, then add cocoa & chocolate and mix gently. Avoid over-mixing.
5. Optionally refrigerate for a while to facilitate easier handling.
6. Scoop onto 2 (baking paper lined) trays in 12 portions (a 1/4 cup measure works well for portioning); don't flatten. Top with coarse salt.
7. Bake for ~7min, then rotate each tray about its vertical axis & swap trays' positions in oven. Bake for another ~7min.
8. Remove & bang trays on counter-top to flatten cookies. Leave to cool for ~1h.

# Notes

- Obviously, variations in flavour are possible. The base recipe serves as a good versatile vegan cookie.
