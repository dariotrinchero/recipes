# Ingredients

- 750 g / 1.5 lb cream cheese blocks , room temperature
- 1 cup caster / superfine sugar (regular white sugar ok too)
- 1 1/4 cups whipping cream , take out of fridge 15 minutes prior
- 1/4 cup flour , plain/all-purpose
- 1 tsp vanilla bean extract or paste
- 3/4 cups + 1 tbsp lightly whisked eggs , at room temperature, ~4-5 large eggs (yes, I need you to measure!)

# Method

#### Shorthand recipe

1. **Prep** – Preheat oven to 220°C / 425°F (200°C fan) with the shelf in the middle. Press scrunched paper into 20cm/8" springform pan.
2. **Batter –** Beat cream cheese 2 minutes on medium. Beat in sugar on low speed for 10 seconds. In separate bowl, hand whisk 1/4 cup cream with the flour (becomes like paste). Whisk in remaining cream and vanilla. While beating on low, slowly pour cream into cream cheese, then eggs (don't overbeat).
3. **Bake** – Pour into pan, bang pan on counter, pop bubbles with knife. Bake 45 min (up to 65 min possible) until top deep golden. Cool 2 hrs on counter then 8 hrs+ in fridge uncovered. Ready for serving!

#### Full instructions recipe

1. **Preheat oven** to 220°C / 425°F (200°C fan) with the shelf in the middle of the oven.
2. **Pan prep** – Press 2 x 40cm/16" sheets of scrunched up baking/parchment paper arranged in an "X" into a 20cm/8" springform pan (6cm / 2.5" tall), and fold down over the rim to hold in place. You'll need to scrunch/pleat to fit which creates the signature rustic sides! The batter will weigh it down so don't worry if it doesn't stay in.
3. **Beat the cream cheese** in a large bowl on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed, until smooth and lump-free. Add sugar and beat on low speed for 10 seconds.
4. **Flour & cream** – Put about 1/4 of the cream and all the flour in a medium bowl. Hand whisk until lump free (it will be paste-like), then slowly pour in the remaining cream while whisking. Once flour is incorporated, whisk in vanilla. (PS not making whipped cream here! Should be pourable)
5. **Slowly pour the cream** into the cream cheese bowl with the beater going on low. Beat just until combined. Then slowly pour the eggs in while the beater is still on low speed. As soon as the eggs are incorporated, stop beating to minimise getting bubbles in the batter.
6. **Remove air bubbles** – Pour into the prepared pan. Bang the pan on the counter then pop bubbles that rise to the surface with a small sharp knife. I do repeat 3 to 5 times.
7. **Bake** 45 minutes or until the surface is a deep golden brown. It can take up to 65 minutes and that's fine! Keep a close eye on it for the last 15 minutes, you want it deeply golden but not burnt. The centre will still be wobbly and the cake will rise like a soufflé.
8. **Chill overnight –** Cool in the cake pan for at least 2 hours on the counter (it will sink, that's normal). Then refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours, uncovered.
9. **Serving** – Release the sides of the springform pan. Hold excess paper overhang to lift off base onto a cutting board or plate. Fold down sides – I love serving it on the paper, it's part of the visuals! Bring to room temp for 30 minutes if time permits, though also great served chilled. Cut like cake!

# Notes

- A berry coulis on this is amazing.
- #todo/cooking Compare this to [Hellen Rennie's recipe](https://youtu.be/vUwzdJhqp4g).
- A good similarly-rich and luxurious alternative to the [[Chocolate Mousse (Cake)]].
