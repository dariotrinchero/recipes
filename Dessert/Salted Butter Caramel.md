# Ingredients

- 300g granulated sugar  
- 3 Tbsp water  
- 240g butter, cut into small pieces  
- 5g salt  
- 200g cream (room temperature)

# Method

1. Place the sugar and water in a saucepan, and cook on low heat until it turns golden brown. Only stir as much as needed (see note below) or your sugar will crystallise. You want a golden caramel - not too dark, or it will taste bitter. 
2. Add the butter little by little while gently stirring with a spoon. (Be careful! The mixture is very hot; it sizzles and might splatter.) Add the salt and cook while stirring constantly until all the butter is incorporated. (The fat and sugar will come together as an emulsion).  
3. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and add the cream. (Careful again, this might splatter as well!) Mix until well combined. The mixture is now still liquid but will get firmer and spreadable when colder.
4. Pour into jars and let cool.

# Notes

- The spread should keep for at least three months in the refrigerator.
- **A few notes on cooking the sugar**: 
	1. When you cook your sugar, stir as little as possible. It's actually enough to just rotate the pan a bit.
	2. Cook it until you get a golden brown colour (about 5 minutes on the highest temperature); if you have a thermometer, 190Â° C is perfect, but don't worry - the range is not too small; a golden brown colour is as good as a lightly golden brown one; just don't burn it.
	3. Some people find it better to do this step without water. Adding water just makes it easier for you: it helps the sugar to heat evenly in the pan. All the water will be evaporated when your sugar gets golden so the result is exactly the same.
