# Ingredients

## The Cake

- 200g butter, softened
- 300g caster sugar for the cake
- 80g caster sugar for the syrup
- 4 clementines or oranges, zest grated and juiced
- 1 lemon, zest grated and juiced
- 280g ground almonds
- 5 medium eggs
- 100g plain flour
- pinch of salt
- orange zest, cut into strips

## The Chocolate Icing

- 90g unsalted butter
- 150g dark chocolate
- 1/2 tbsp honey
- 1/2 tbsp brandy

# Method

## The Cake

1. line a 24cm cake tin
2. heat the oven to 180C (160C  fan)
3. combine the butter,  citrus zest and caster sugar
    1. don’t beat or cream – you must not add too much air
    1. just stir together until combined
4. add half the almonds and stir in
5. add the eggs one at a time and stir in until well combined
6. fold in the remaining almonds
7. sift the flour and salt and fold into the mixture
8. stir until smooth
9. pour into the cake tin and smooth with a palette knife
10. bake in the oven for 50 minutes until a skewer comes out dry
11. cool in the tin adding the syrup as soon as the cake is out of the oven

## The Syrup

1. use all the lemon juice and enough orange juice to make up 120ml
2. add 80g of sugar
3. just before the cake is ready, bring the syrup straight to the boil
4. drizzle over the cake as soon as it is out the oven
5. allow the cake to cool

At this stage you can choose to serve the cake just as it is, garnished with some orange zest strips.  Alternatively you can now cover it with the chocolate icing.

## The Chocolate Icing

1. take the cake out of the cake tin
2. place on a wire rack with a dish underneath
3. break up the chocolate
4. add the chocolate, brandy and butter into a bowl
5. place the bowl over a pan of boiling water and heat until the chocolate is melted
6. pour over the cake in one clean pour allowing it to dribble down the sides
7. allow the icing to set
8. decorate with orange zest strips
