# Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 200 grams light soft brown sugar
- 150 grams caster sugar

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1.5 tablespoons espresso coffee

- 150 grams dark chocolate
- 150 grams butter

- 1oz all purpose flour
- 3oz almond ground (**key ingredient!**)
- 40 grams of cocoa powder

- 60 grams chocolate chunks

# Method

There are 5 simple stages, corresponding to the grouping of the ingredients above.

1. Beat the eggs and the sugars, ideally with a mixer.
2. Fold in the flavouring enhancements: vanilla and espresso.
3. Melt the chocolate and the butter and fold them in the mixture .
4. Fold the flours / cocoa powder after sifting .
5. Fold in the chocolate chunks.

Bake at 180 Celsius for 30-35 minutes in a 23cm x 23cm pan - this will depend on the oven.

# Notes

- Unlike most other recipes, there is notably **no oil** in this recipe, yet the brownies turn out lovely and fudgey. I think this is because of the ground almonds, most of all.
