# Ingredients

## Pastry (makes 2 logs, each of which produce 8-10 tarts)

- 290g unbleached all-purpose flour
- 2.1g salt (3/4 tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher or heaping 1/4 tsp table salt)
- 180g cold water 
- 227g unsalted butter at room temp (82% fat European-style if possible), divided into 3 portions (70g, 70g, 86g).

## Custard (for 1 log of pastry) - *see Notes*

- 24g ap flour
- Pinch of salt
- 100g milk
- 80g cream 
- A few strips of lemon zest removed with a peeler
- 75g maple syrup (from the fridge)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch of cinnamon
- 1 tsp pomegranate molasses
- 3 yolks
- 1 plum, sliced paper thin (optional)

# Method

## Making the dough

1. Put the flour and salt into a bowl of a stand mixer. Mix. Add the water, mix with a dough hook by hand to get it started. Mix with a mixer on med-low speed until you get a ball, scrape, and mix until the dough is homogeneous, but not smooth. Turn up the speed to medium and mix for 30 seconds. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and shape into a 6”x6” (15cm x 15cm) square. Cover and rest it for 15 min. 
2. **First letter turn**: Roll the dough into an 18-inch (46-cm) square. Use plenty of flour and check for sticking often.
3. Brush the excess flour off the top of the dough, trim any uneven edges, and, using an offset spatula, dot and then spread the left 2/3 portion of the dough with 70g well mixed butter being careful to leave a 1 inch (25 mm) border around the edge of the dough. 
4. Neatly fold the unbuttered right 1/3 of the dough (using the pastry scraper to loosen it if it sticks) over the rest of the dough. Brush off any excess flour, then fold over the left 1/3 of the dough. Trim the uneven edges.
5. Turn the dough 90° to the left so the fold is facing you. Repeat the rolling, buttering, and folding with the second 70g portion of butter for a second letter turn.
6. For the last rolling, turn the dough 90° to the left (to make the fold face you) and roll out the dough to an 18-by-21-inch (46-by-53-cm) rectangle, with the shorter side facing you. Spread the remaining 86g of butter over the entire surface of the dough leaving 1 inch border on all sides except for the one facing you. Roll the dough away from you into a tight log, brushing the excess flour from the underside as you go. Trim the ends and cut the log in half. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and chill overnight. You can place a plastic wrapped log into a freezer bag and freeze for up to 3 months.

## Shaping the dough

1. Preheat the oven to 500F (260C) with the rack in the bottom third. 
2. Butter the tart pans, slice a log of dough into 10 pieces (8 if using a muffin pan, but you should do one trial tart to figure out a good size of dough pieces). If using American butter, wait for the dough to soften slightly, 15-20 min. Flour all the dough pieces and shake off excess. Press into the tart pans with thumbs. The dough should stick out above the top of the pans by 1/4 inch (0.65 cm). Place on a parchment lined baking sheet (do that even if using a muffin pan) and refrigerate for at least 15 min (and up to several hours) while making the custard.

## Making the custard

1. Put the flour and salt into a bowl. Put the milk, cream and zest into a pyrex cup and microwave until boiling. Add enough milk mixture to the flour to create a thick paste (about half of milk mixture). Whisk until no lumps remain. Slowly add the rest. Add maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, pomegranate molasses, and whisk to combine. Cool to warm. Whisk in the yolks. Strain through a fine mesh sieve. Can be covered and refrigerated for a few hours if you can’t bake right away.

## Finishing the tarts

1. Overlap 3 plum slices and roll them up into rosettes. Make as many as you have tarts. You might not need the whole plum. If cutting them thin is difficult, cut them into small pieces and use a few small pieces per tart.
2. Pour the custard into the tarts leaving the top 1/2 inch (1.25cm) empty. If you have extra custard, discard or save for another use. Don’t overfill the tarts since the custard will puff up a lot and can spill out and burn. Put the plums in the center of each tart (the amount of plum should be small enough that the level of custard should barely rise). Bake at 500F (260C) in the bottom third of the oven for 12 min. Turn on convection and bake until the dough is brown, the custard is spotty on top, and the custard passes 180F (82C), 2-4 min. If they are plenty brown, but the custard isn’t there yet, turn off the oven and let them finish for a minute or 2.
3. Cool for 5 min. Remove from the tart pans using tongs and place on a cooling rack. Cool for 15-20 minutes or until warm, but not hot, and serve. These are best just baked.
