# Ingredients

- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 6 large egg yolks
- sugar to taste (from 1/6 to 2/3 cup)
- salt to taste (about 1/2 tsp)

# Method

1. In a double-boiler, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream.
3. Gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
4. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturers’ instructions.

# Notes

- As soon as you turn the churner off, get the ice cream out immediately, or it will solidify.

# Flavour Ideas

## Tried & Tested

- Apple crumble
- Earl Grey, cardamom & orange zest (with slivered almonds)
- Browned butter & sage
    - do not add too much butter – it affects the final texture
    - try skim the clarified butter off, and only add the browned milk solids
    - maybe try adding milk powder to the butter while browning to increase proportion of milk solids?
