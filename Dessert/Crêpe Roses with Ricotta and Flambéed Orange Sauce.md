# Ingredients

## Crêpes

- unbleached all-purpose flour (7.5 oz / 213g / 1.5 cups)
- salt (2 tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher / 1 tsp Table)
- sugar (2 tsp)
- eggs (5.3 oz / 150g / 3 large) weighed without shell
- water (8.3 oz / 236g / 1 cup)
- whole or 2% milk (8.5 oz / 242g / 1 cup)
- neutral oil (1.9 oz / 54g / 0.25 cup)

## Sauce

- zest from 1 navel orange
- 2 cups of fresh squeezed orange juice (from Juice or Valencia oranges)
- 1/3 cup (2.3 oz) sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- pinch of salt
- 3 Tbsp (1.5 oz) butter
- 1/4 cup (2 oz) grand marnier
- Optional fresh fruit like raspberries and orange sections (recommended!).

## Filling

- 2 Lb whole milk ricotta (after draining weigh out 450g)
- 50g golden raisins (1/3 cup)
- 2 yolks from large eggs
- 50 g sugar (1/4 cup)
- 1 tsp vanilla paste or extract
- 85 g sour cream (1/3 cup)

## Frying

- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter at **_room temperature_** for the skillet

# Method

## Crêpes

These are prepared as per [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEV4Fmo2f54). The video is helpful regarding the flipping technique, so do check it out,

1. Mix the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl, and whisk together. Then add eggs and water, and whisk thoroughly to remove lumps. Don't worry about over-mixing.
2. Add the milk and oil, and whisk. The batter should just coat the back of a spoon.
3. Cover and rest for at least 30min, or up to 12h.
4. A crêpe pan should be lightweight, non-stick, and have slanted sides. Ordinary non-stick works here, but specialised pans are optimal.  Lightly butter the whole pan over heat by rubbing the butter stick on the hot pan.
5. When the butter sizzles and the foam starts to subside, bring the pan to the batter, pour some batter in the middle, and slowly swirl the pan to let the batter spread all over the butter. Set the batter back on the stove, and wait for the top of the batter to get dry, and for the edges to get golden-brown.
6. To flip, first firmly shake the pan to ensure the crêpe is loose, then make a circular motion with your hand, like turning a crank.
7. Once both sides are lightly golden, plate.

## Filling

1. Remove butter from fridge, if not already.
2. Put raisins into a bowl. Cover in boiling water and a squirt of lemon juice. Allow to sit for at least 30min.
3. If your ricotta is very wet, you will need to dry it out some. For this:
	1. Place a layer of foil on the counter, covered in 3 layers of paper towel. Spread over the ricotta, then 3 more layers of paper towel, and some more foil. 
	2. Place a weight on top, and allow to drain for about 20min.
	3. Repeat a second time.
4. Whisk yolks and sugar together until the mixture is very thick and pale yellow (about 2min).
5. Add vanilla paste/extract, sour cream, and ricotta.
6. Whip everything together until smooth.
7. Drain and dry the soaked raisins, and fold into ricotta mixture.

## Sauce (see Notes for timing this)

1. Combine the orange juice, zest, vanilla extract, and sugar in a stainless steel skillet. Cook on high-heat, whisking occasionally, until the liquid turns slightly syrupy (roughly reduce by half).
2. Add a pinch of salt, and the butter. Whisk until the butter incorperates.
3. Optionally add some fresh fruit at this stage.
4. Add Grand Marnier (pour from a cup, not the bottle!). Hold a lighter near where the alcohol was poured, and wait to ignite. Do not bring your face near the pan! If the alcohol does not light, no problem.
5. Once the flames subside (or after a few minutes), the sauce is ready.

## Assembly

If serving today, preheat the oven to 175 Celsius now. Otherwise, skip this step if the intention is to pre-assemble the crêpes to be served on a future date.

1. Spread softened butter on the bottom (and slightly up the sides) of a 10" stainless steel skillet.
2. Spread about 2Tbsp of filling in a strip along the middle of the diameter of each crêpe. Fold in half; flatten out the filling; fold the thick filling-containing strip upwards once; then roll into a rose. Ensure that no crêpes have rips at the bottom. If there are any rips, rather double-up the crêpe layers.
3. Place all of the roses in the skillet, all snug and touching. 
   
If you did the previous 3 steps the day before, then time step 5 below to coincide with having your orange juice on the stove busy reducing.

4. Preheat the oven to 175 Celsius, if not already heated.
5. Cover the skillet in buttered foil, and place in the middle of the oven for 15min.
6. Set the warmed crêpes over medium heat on the stovetop. Remove the foil, and cook just until they brown on the bottom (about 5min). Make sure the heat is not too high!
7. Remove from heat, and pour over orange sauce (and optional fruit, if included).

# Notes

- I think the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDxnlw1eDr8) really helps with this recipe (as with most Helen Rennie recipes). Use this writeup mainly as a reference guide while following the video.
- Do not buy pre-squeezed orange juice. Orange juice is very perishable, and the flavour degrades quickly!
- **Pre-making**: It is very convenient to make up to Assembly step 3 the day before serving (do not make the sauce just yet!). Then one can cover the skillet in cling-wrap and refrigerate overnight. The next day, resume with step 4 of the Assembly, while beginning work on the sauce.
