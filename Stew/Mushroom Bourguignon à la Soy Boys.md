# Ingredients

- 8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 5 pounds portobello mushroom caps, cleaned (if necessary) + quartered + divided
- 1½ cups pearl onions, divided
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt + more to taste
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper + more to taste
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 4 cups vegetable or “not-beef” Stock
- 1 (750-ml) bottle red wine, divided
- 2 tablespoons agar-agar flakes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon white miso paste
- 2 yellow onions, roughly chopped
- 2 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 garlic head, cloves separated (unpeeled) and smashed
- 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
- 8-10 sprigs fresh parsley
- 4-6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- Mashed potatoes
- To garnish: chopped parsley

# Method

1. Add 3 tablespoons of the oil to a medium pot or dutch oven. Heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering, then add half of the mushrooms, half of the pearl onions, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper. Stir to combine the ingredients, then cover the pot and cook until the mushrooms have released all of their liquid, 6-8 minutes. Uncover the skillet or pot and increase the temperature to medium-high. Continue cooking the vegetables until all of the moisture has evaporated, 8-10 minutes. Transfer the cooked vegetables to large bowl and reserve.
2. Repeat step 1 with another 3 tablespoons of oil and the remaining mushrooms, pearl onions, salt, and pepper. Reserve the second batch of vegetables in the same bowl as the first.
3. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pot and heat for over medium-high heat. Whisk the flour into the oil until a dry paste forms. Cook the roux for 1-2 minutes or until it turns golden brown.
4. Very slowly pour the broth into the roux, while whisking constantly. The mixture should thicken as the roux is incorporated into the liquid.
5. Once all of the broth is incorporated, stir in the agar-agar, tomato paste, miso paste, yellow onions, carrots, garlic, porcini mushrooms, parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, peppercorns, and 2 cups of wine.
6. Bring the mixture to boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 12 - 15 minutes.
7. Strain the mixture and reserve the cooking liquid. Then, return the liquid back to the pot and stir in the remaining wine.
8. Bring the stew to boil over medium heat. Cook, while stirring periodically, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 6-8 minutes.
9. Reduce the heat to a simmer, then add the reserved mushroom/onion mixture, and cook until just heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
10. Serve the stew over mashed potatoes and garnish with chopped parsley.
