# Method

## To make the fried bread

1. Slice your bread into 1 inch (bite sized) pieces
2. Place some frying oil in a pot and heat over medium high heat
3. Place a paper towel on a plate or tray and set to the side of your cooking station
4. Add the bread to the pot, and fry for about 30 seconds while stirring, until it is a light golden colour
5. Remove immediately and place on the paper towels. Colour will continue to darken after removing
6. Spread the bread evenly in a single layer and sprinkle over a little salt

## To make the fried onions

1. Thinly slice the onions using a knife or mandolin (from tip to root)
2. Prepare an oven tray with paper towels, and set it to the side
3. Place your onions in a pot, and pour on enough olive oil to almost cover the onions
4. Turn the heat to high and let these cook and start wilting
5. Stir the pot every 20-30 seconds, and about 8 minutes after starting they will begin to darken
6. Once they turn a light golden colour, remove immediately and place on the paper towels
7. Spread the onions with forks, and then sprinkle on some salt
8. Change the paper towels after 10 minutes to maintain crispiness
9. Strain the oil and set it aside

## To make the tamarind

1. Break your tamarind block into smaller pieces and place in a bowl
2. Pour over 1l of boiling water
3. Let this sit for 30-40 minutes
4. Mash the tamarind with a potato masher, then pour the liquid through a coarse strainer

## To make the harak osbao

1. In a pot (same one for frying onions), bring 1L of water to a boil
2. Wash your lentils thoroughly, then add them to the pot, and cover with a tight fitting lid
3. Cook for 20-30 minutes until soft and tender, but not bursting
4. Meanwhile take your pasta and cook it for 1/3-1/2 the cooking time on the packet
5. Drain your pasta, then wash it thoroughly with cold water
6. When the lentils are done cooking, the liquid should be mostly absorbed
7. Add the pasta, as well as the tamarind liquid, pomegranate molasses, salt, pepper, a handful of fried onions, and 1/3 cup of the onion olive oil. Mix thoroughly then top up with water until pasta is submerged
8. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to medium high and cover with a tight fitting lid. Cook for 10 minutes more
9. Meanwhile in a pan, add 1/3 cup olive oil over medium high heat, and when heated add your minced garlic
10. Fry for 30 seconds, then add your coriander, which you should remove the stalks from and roughly chop
11. Fry for 30 seconds more, and when the pasta is done cooking, add this garlic mixture to the pot
12. Mix thoroughly and set to the side

## To assemble

1. Pour the harak osbao into a deep serving dish, then use a spatula to flatten it
2. Let this cool for about 30 minutes until the top has solidified
3. Place your toppings on in any pattern, then serve with more toppings on the side
4. Serve and Enjoy

# Notes

- The recipe assumes a block of tamarind fruit. I usually use the stuff from a jar, in which case, I disregard the instructions pertaining to the tamarind, and just add a tablespoon at a time to taste, in step 7 of the "Harak Osbao" stage of the Method.
- You can absolutely leave off the fresh coriander, fried pita, fried onions, and pomegranate seeds. This makes a less caloric, and way quicker version of the meal, which remains delicious.
