# Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
- 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 cups (480 ml) vegetable broth
- 400g peeled and finely diced butternut squash
- 2 cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste
- 1 can crushed tomatoes
- 6+ large medjool dates, chopped (or several more of other smaller date varieties)
- 1 medium lemon, zested + 1 tablespoon juice
- 1 big handful of flat-leaf parsley (or cilantro) leaves and tender stems, chopped

## Spice mix

- 1 tablespoon ras el hanout
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ¼ to ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, ½ tsp for some good heat)
- A generous crack of black pepper
- A pinch of ground cloves

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 190ºC. Arrange an oven rack to fit a Dutch oven (or tagine pan, if you have one) or braising pan.
2. Stir together the spices for the Spice Mix.
3. Heat the 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions and season with a pinch of salt. Cook until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes, adding a splash of water as needed to deglaze the pan and prevent the onions from burning. Add the bell pepper, garlic, and cinnamon stick, and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Add the Spice Mix and stir vigorously for 1 minute. If it starts to dry out, add a splash of water.
5. Pour in some of the broth to deglaze the pot and scrape up any browned bits. Add the remaining broth, squash, chickpeas, bay leaves, salt, tomatoes, and dates. Stir, and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, and drizzle with a nice glug of olive oil, and stir again to combine. Place the lid on the pan and ensure it’s fitted tightly.
6. Transfer to the oven and bake, covered, for 40 minutes, or until squash is tender and the mixture is thick and stew-like.
7. For the best flavor, cool for 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in half of the zest and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Taste, adding more lemon zest or juice as desired.
8. Serve in bowls topped with yogurt sauce, chopped parsley or cilantro, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, alongside some flat-breads.
