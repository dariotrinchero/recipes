# Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup avocado oil
- 2 Yukon gold potatoes, about 3/4 pound total, peeled and diced
- 1 head of garlic, divided
- 1 big turnip, divided
- 2 15- ounce can white beans, like butter or great northern, drained and rinsed
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- Fresh herbs for garnish, like celery leaves or parsley
- Salt and pepper to taste

# Method

1. Peel the garlic cloves. Thinly slice three of the bigger cloves and then mince the remaining. Peel the turnip and cut off about 1/4 of the turnip. Dice the larger half of the turnip. Very thinly slice the smaller half of the turnip into paper-thin half-moons.
2. Cover the Yukon gold potatoes with water in a medium pot and season with salt. Bring to a boil and then cook until fork tender. Scoop out 3 cups of the potato cooking water and set aside. Drain the potatoes and transfer them to a second bowl and then mash until completely smooth. Set aside. Wash out the pot used to cook the potatoes and return it to the stove-top as you will use it to fry the turnips.
3. Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a wide pot. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 45 seconds being careful not to burn it. Add the white beans and Dijon mustard and stir to coat. Add the 3 cups of potato cooking water along with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil.
4. Spoon the mashed potatoes into the broth and whisk until completely smooth. Continue whisking until the potatoes are fully incorporated into the broth. It will take a few minutes for it to completely combine into a smooth broth. Just keep whisking! Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add more water, as necessary, to thin the broth out to your desired consistency.
5. Add the diced turnips to the broth and reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until the turnips are fork-tender.
6. Add the avocado oil to the pot used to cook the potatoes and turn the heat to medium or medium-high depending on your stove. Once hot and shimmering, add the very thinly sliced turnips in an even layer and cook, turning occasionally, for 1–2 minutes per side until golden brown. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.
7. Add the thinly sliced garlic to the hot oil and stir constantly for 1 minute until golden brown. Spoon onto the paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.
8. Taste the broth once more and season with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat. Ladle the broth into bowls and garnish with the crispy turnips and garlic. Add your favourite herbs on top. Enjoy!
