# Ingredients

- 2.5 - 3 cups boiling water
- 1 cup red split lentils
- Â½ teaspoon salt

# Method

1. Add the boiling water, lentils, and salt (if using) to your blender. Let the lentils soak in the blender with the lid off for 15 minutes, or until the lentils look pale and softened. Once the lentils have softened, put the lid on the blender and blend the mixture until it is completely smooth. If the water is still hot, be careful when blending, start blending at the lowest speed, gradually increasing the speed to ensure it doesn't erupt.
2. Once blended, pour the lentil mixture into a medium saucepan. Put over medium-high heat, and whisk continually as it cooks, until the lentil mixture gets thick, this will take about 5 minutes.
3. It will start to set almost right away so working quickly, pour it into a heat-safe container and spread it evenly. I used a glass food storage container, but you could alternatively use a baking dish, or silicone baking mould. No need to grease your dish. Let the lentil tofu set and chill in the fridge. Once set you can cut and bake, fry, or air fry, just like soy tofu!
