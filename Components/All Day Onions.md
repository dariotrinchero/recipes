# Ingredients

- ~3kg white onions, thinly sliced pole-to-pole
- Salt
- ~100ml sunflower oil
- < 1/4 cup brown sugar (optional)

# Method

1. Put all of the sliced onions into a large pot.
2. Place on medium high heat tightly covered until wilted. Stir carefully with a wooden spoon every so often.
3. Once totally reduced in volume (and covered in onion liquid), bring to a gentle simmer, and stir occasionally (every 5-10min) with a wooden spoon.
4. Once most of the liquid has evaporated (about 3h in, usually), blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
5. Continue cooking on low until onions reach applesauce consistency. From this point, constant stirring is needed to avoid burning.
6. The onions are done as soon as their consistency changes to that of a thick paste / dough. They should be dark in colour.
7. Cool to room temperature, then freeze in an airtight bag.

# Notes

- This recipe is meant to be made once and frozen, to be added later to just about anything.
- The final product should keep for several months.
