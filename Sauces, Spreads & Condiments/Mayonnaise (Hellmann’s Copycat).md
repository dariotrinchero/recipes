# Ingredients

- 1 whole free range-egg
- 1 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice
- 1 1/2 tsp white wine vinegar
- 1/2 tsp fine salt (see notes)
- 1/2 tsp caster sugar finer than granulated sugar
- 1/4 tsp Dijon mustard
- knife tip pinch of cayenne pepper
- 200 ml neutral oil such as sunflower or canola avocado oil could also work

# Method

1. Break your egg into the jug/jar and add all the seasonings.
2. Place your stick blender over the egg ensuring the blades touch the egg itself. Pour the oil into the jug.
3. Holding the stick blender down start blending at a high speed and wait for the emulsion to occur. This should start happening quite soon after you start blending. Once this has happened slowly lift the blender slightly to incorporate more of the oil.
4. Once the mayonnaise is well on its way to being thick and emulsified (there will still be some oil that has not been mixed in),  pull the immersion blender up and down to get the rest of the oil incorporated.
5. When your mayonnaise is thick and well blended, adjust your seasoning to your taste preference. 
6. Store in a sealed jar for up to a month in the fridge.

# Notes

- Beware of the salt measurement. I actually find it better to eyeball a "generous pinch" of salt.
