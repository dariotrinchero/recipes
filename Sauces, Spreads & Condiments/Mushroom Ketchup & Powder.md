# Ingredients

- Large batch of mushrooms
- Salt
- Autumnal spice blend, to taste (consider cloves, mace, nutmeg, allspice, ginger)

# Method

## Ketchup

1. Crush mushrooms by hand.
2. Heavily salt, then rest overnight.
3. The next day, add spice mix, then simmer mushrooms in their juices for ~10min.
4. Allow to cool, then squeeze through a cheese cloth.
5. Finally, simmer extracted liquid for a further 10-20min to reduce a little, to taste.

## Powder

1. Take the squeezed mushrooms from above, and lay them out on a baking sheet.
2. If the weather is hot and not windy, leave them out in the sun for a day or two to dry. Otherwise, dehydrate in the oven on a low temperature with the fan on.
3. Grind into powder, which can be used as seasoning.

# Notes

- Do **not**, under any circumstances, add horseradish!
- Be sure to bottle in a well-sterilised bottle, and the sauce to last up to 2y.
