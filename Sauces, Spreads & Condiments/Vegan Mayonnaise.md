# Ingredients

- 1/4 cup aquafaba
- 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard
- generous pinch of salt
- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp sugar + extra to taste
- neutral oil to emulsify (avoid canola - it leads to a fishy taste)

## Optional flavourings 

- 1 tsp nutritional yeast flakes
- sprinkle of MSG
- tiny splash of Maggi Aromé sauce (~1/4 tsp)
- knife-tip pinch of chilli powder

# Method

1. Add all of the ingredients except the oil into a jug. Ensure that the diameter of the jug closely matches that of a stick blender, such that the head of the blender can be fully submerged.
2. With the blender running, stream in oil until desired thickness is reached. Taste and adjust salt, sugar, lemon, and flavourings after initial emulsification, but before the mayonnaise has fully thickened.

# Notes

- This is a good vegan alternative to [[Mayonnaise (Hellmann’s Copycat)]]; the final texture and flavour is similar.
