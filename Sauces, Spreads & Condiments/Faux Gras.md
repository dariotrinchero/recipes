# Ingredients

- 150 g cashews (mass prior to soaking overnight)
- 50 g shiitake mushrooms (if using dried shiitake, this is the mass after soaking overnight, then lightly squeezing out excess water; you can add a bit more than this with no harm)
- 1.5 g tapioca starch
- 1.3 g agar agar
- .6 g xantham gum
- 8 g kosher salt
- 1.5 g black pepper
- pinch nutmeg
- pinch cinnamon
- 2 g allspice
- pinch ginger powder
- 110 ml brandy
- 15 g tomato paste (a bit more is fine)
- 25 g white miso (a bit more is fine)
- 85 g coconut oil
- 2 g black strap molasses (a bit more is fine)
- .5 g yeast extract (this mass is for powder; I would add a couple grams of Marmite)
- 90 g shallots (a bit more is fine)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 275 ml water
- .5 stick vegan butter

# Method

## Summer spice blend

- In bowl add nutmeg, cinnamon, all spice, yeast extract (if powdered), and ginger powder

## Faux Gras

1. Soak cashews and shiitake mushrooms **overnight**.
2. Slice up shallots, mushrooms, and garlic.
3. Add coconut oil to saucepan on low heat, let it melt. Add onions, shallots, mushrooms, let them dry out a little.
4. Add bourbon and rest of ingredients except binders. Bring it to boil, let cook for about ten minutes.
5. With an opening in blender, add your mixture and blend at a low speed. Add the agar agar, gums and blend at higher speed.
6. Add mixture to bowl. Melt vegan butter and pour over the top of your mixture (optional).
7. Toss in the refrigerator for a few hours to hardenâ€¦ enjoy!

# Notes

- It can be a mission to weigh the binding agents. I find that the recipe has a little bit of leeway on those masses, so one can estimate based on, say, the mass of a tablespoon of each agent.
