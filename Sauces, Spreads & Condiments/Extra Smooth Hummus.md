# Ingredients

- 500g dried chickpeas
- 1.5-2L water
- 100g sunflower oil (or 110ml)
- 450g tahini paste (light colour)
- 200ml lemon juice
- 2.5 tsp salt
- 150-200g ice

### For Beiruty hummus (optional variant)

- 1 Cup Hummus
- 2 Tbsp Parsley
- 1 Tsp Mint
- 1 Clove Garlic
- 2 Tbsp Lemon Juice
- 1/2 Tsp Chilli flakes

# Method

## To prepare the chickpeas

 1. Add your dry chickpeas to a bowl and completely submerge with water. Allow them to soak for 8-12h or overnight
 2. Rinse your chickpeas, then add to a pot with the baking soda. Pour water over the chickpeas to cover them by about 2 inches
 3. Turn the heat up to high and bring the pot to a boil. When the chickpeas foam up, stir the foam back into the pot and turn the heat to medium.
 4. Cook for half an hour, then remove some of the chickpeas and set aside to use as a garnish later
 5. Place a lid on your pot and cook the chickpeas for another 30-60 minutes on medium
 6. The chickpeas are done cooking when they are extremely soft and have burst. They should mash very easily and the skins should have dissolved
 7. Allow any extra water to evaporate away
 8. Pour the cooked chickpeas onto a plate, and allow it to cool completely until room temp (You can freeze these and defrost them whenever you want hummus)

## To make the hummus

 1. Add your prepared chickpeas to a food processor or blender, and process for ~5 minutes, scraping down the side of the bowl halfway, until the chickpeas are processed into a super fine paste. If this is lumpy, you need to process longer. Feel it between your fingers and it should be floury.
 2. Stream vegetable oil in, while running food processor. Pause and scrape down a few times, and process until even and light in colour.
 3. Add tahini and process until evenly mixed.
 4. Add lemon juice and salt, and process until evenly mixed.
 5.  Add ice piece-by-piece into the food processor, while the machine is running. Stop once the desired texture has been achieved.
 6. Store in the fridge for up to a week.

## To make Beiruty hummus

 1. Finely chop the parsley and mint
 2. Add all the ingredients into a bowl and mix well

## To serve hummus

 1. Place a pile on a plate or bowl
 2. Use the inside of the spoon to build the hummus up into a mound, while rotating the plate
 3. Use the back of the spoon to push the hummus outwards and create the classic well shape
 4. Add your toppings such as chickpeas, then pour in olive oil

# Notes

- **To use canned chickpeas:** Wash the chickpeas thoroughly then add to the pot with the baking soda. Bring to a boil, then cook from step 5 onwards.
