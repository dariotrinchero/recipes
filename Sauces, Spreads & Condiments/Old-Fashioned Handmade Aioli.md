# Ingredients

- 3 large cloves of garlic
- 1/2 lemon or bottled juice
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard (or more, to taste)
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Course salt & black pepper
- A few leaves of tarragon (optional)

# Method

1. Peel the garlic without damaging/crushing garlic, and place into a mortar.
2. Squeeze a touch of fresh lemon juice over the garlic. Season with a generous pinch of coarse salt.
3. Start pounding the garlic with a pestle, initially using a mashing motion, then transitioning into a rotating grinding motion.
4. Add the egg yolk into the mortar. Continue grinding the garlic. After a few seconds of grinding, add Dijon mustard.
5. Continue grinding, while slowly pouring olive oil into the side of the mortar. The emulsion should thicken and become more pale. As the emulsion becomes more stable, one can begin adding olive oil more in batches.
6. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If the aioli is too strong, continue adding a bit more olive oil. If it gets too greasy or thick, one should add a touch of water. Just be careful to add a tiny amount at a time.
7. **If using tarragon:** Remove stems, finely chop leaves, then add to aioli.
