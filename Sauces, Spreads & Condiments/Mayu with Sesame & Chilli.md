# Ingredients

- 1/4 cup canola or vegetable oil
- 12 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 4 tablespoons)
- 1/4 cup roasted sesame oil
- 2 red Thai bird chillies, finely minced
- 6 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Kosher salt

# Method

1. Combine canola oil and 10 cloves minced garlic in a small saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until it starts to brown. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until garlic turns completely black, about 10 minutes (garlic will become very sticky in the process).
2. Transfer mixture to a heat-proof bowl and add sesame oil. Transfer to a blender and blend on high speed until completely pulverised, about 30 seconds. Return mixture to saucepan and add chillies and remaining garlic. Cook gently over low heat until chillies and fresh garlic begins to bubble. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
3. Grind sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle or a food processor until roughly ground but some large pieces still remain. Stir sesame seeds and sugar into oil mixture. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to a sealable container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.
