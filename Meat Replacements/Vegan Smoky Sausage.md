# Ingredients

## Dry

- 180g vital wheat gluten
- 30g chickpea flour
- 30g nutritional yeast
- 1Tbsp tapioca flour
- 1Tbsp onion powder
- 2tsp smoked paprika
- 2tsp ground cumin
- 1tsp ground coriander
- pinch of salt
- 1/4tsp cayenne pepper

## Wet

- 160ml vegetable broth (chicken-style is good)
- 30ml tamari (substitute soy sauce if needed)
- 30ml (vegan) Worcestershire sauce
- 1Tbsp neutral oil
- 1Tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 1Tbsp tomato paste
- 1-2Tbsp liquid smoke, to taste
- 2tsp maple syrup (or honey, or imitation maple syrup)
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed

# Method

1. Whisk together the dry ingredients, and (separately) mix the wet ingredients.
2. Combine the wet & dry ingredients, initially stirring with a fork, then kneading until well-combined. Add up to an extra 1Tbsp broth, or 9g gluten flour, if needed, to make a soft, workable dough.
3. Divide the mixture evenly into 2 pieces. Roll each into a sausage about 15cm long, and wrap each sausage tightly in foil, twisting the ends to seal.
4. Steam the sausages for 1h15min.
5. Carefully remove the foil & allow sausages to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

# Notes

- When wrapped tightly in cling-film, keeps for up to 1 week in the fridge or 2 months in the freezer.
