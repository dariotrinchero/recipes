# Method

1. First, squeeze and slice up your bamboo shoots, then toast them for ~2 minutes over a medium high flame in a dry wok. If you’re planning on making this regularly, you can make a big batch and keep a jar of toasted bamboo shoots handy.
2. Mince up the garlic and the douchi. Measure out the chopped chilis.
3. Boil your noodles of choice to about 80% done.
4. Mix the sauce.
5. **To make the soup**: Heat ~1/2 tbsp of lard / oil over medium-high flame, and fry the garlic, douchi, and chili sauce. Quick mix, then add the bamboo shoots. Another quick mix, then add the prepared sauce & fry for ~15 seconds. Add in the stock, bring up to a boil.
