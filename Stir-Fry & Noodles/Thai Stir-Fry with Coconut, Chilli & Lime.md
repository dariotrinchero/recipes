# Ingredients

- 2 to 3 ~~boneless chicken breasts~~ (**sub for tofu**), cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 shallot (or 1/4 cup purple onion), finely chopped
- 5 to 6 cloves garlic, minced or finely chopped
- 2 thumb-size pieces galangal or ginger, thinly sliced into matchsticks
- 1 fresh red chilli, thinly sliced; or 1/3 teaspoon chilli flakes
- 7 to 8 shiitake (or other type mushrooms), sliced
- 2 cups green beans
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced into strips
- Generous handful fresh basil
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- _**Optional:**_ 2 to 3 makrut lime leaves

## Stir-Fry Sauce

- 2/3 cup coconut milk
- 2+1/2 tablespoons ~~fish sauce~~ (**sub for soy sauce or teriyaki**)
- 3+1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 1+1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1/3 to 1/2 teaspoon chilli flakes
- 2+1/2 teaspoons brown sugar

## For Serving:

- Thai Jasmine rice or noodles

# Method

1. Combine 'Stir-Fry Sauce' ingredients together, stirring well to dissolve the sugar. Taste-test, looking for spicy-salty-sweet flavours balanced with the rich taste of the coconut milk. Adjust these flavours to suit your taste, adding more lime juice if too salty or sweet.
2. Place chicken in a bowl and pour over 1/4 cup of the stir-fry sauce, or enough to coat chicken. Toss well and set aside.
3. Warm a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add oil and swirl around, then add the shallot/onion, garlic, galangal, or ginger, and chilli. Stir-fry until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Add chicken, green beans and lime leaves (if using). Stir-fry 5 to 6 minutes or until cooked, adding more of the stir-fry sauce as you go.
5. Add mushrooms, red pepper, and enough stir-fry sauce to keep ingredients moist and simmering. Simmer 3 to 5 minutes, or until the vegetables have turned bright in colour but still retain some crispness.
6. Reduce heat to minimum and do a final taste-test, adding a little more fish sauce if you'd like more flavour or saltiness, or more lime juice if too salty or sweet.
7. Top with a sprinkling of fresh basil and more fresh-cut chilli, if desired. Serve with plenty of Thai jasmine rice or noodles.

# Notes

- Remember to press and marinade tofu before frying. You can marinade the tofu in the sauce above, then sear; it works fine.
