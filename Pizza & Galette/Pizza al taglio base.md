# Ingredients

- 450g strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- ¼ tsp granulated or caster sugar
- 7g fast-action dried yeast (ie, 1 sachet)
- 70g fine or medium semolina
- 90ml olive oil, plus extra for greasing
- 1 tbsp flaked sea salt

# Method

1. Put the flour, sugar, yeast, 50g of the semolina, 30ml of the oil and 320ml warm (but not boiling hot) water in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Knead for 10 minutes on medium-high speed, adding the salt halfway through, until the mix comes together into a smooth and elastic dough, then tip out on to a lightly floured work surface. Alternatively, mix in a bowl, then knead by hand for 12-15 minutes. The dough should be slightly moist and tacky, but not sticking to your hands: if it is sticky, add a little extra flour.
2. Gently shape the dough into a smooth ball, then put it in a large, lightly oiled bowl, cover and keep in a warm spot for 2h, until doubled in size.
3. Grease a 30cm x 45cm oven tray with 40ml of the remaining oil, then evenly scatter the remaining 30g semolina over the tray. Tip out the dough on to a lightly floured work surface, then, using your knuckles, gently knock out all the air. Gently reshape it into a ball, then use your fingertips to spread it out into a roughly 20cm x 30cm rectangle. Lay this in the centre of the oily tray and leave to rest uncovered for 90 minutes, every now and then stretching the dough towards the corners of the tray, until it is evenly spread right to the very edges and not springing back.
4. Heat the oven to its highest setting – ideally to 250C (230C fan)/480F/gas 9¼; for most people, though, the top setting is 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9, in which case just bake the pizza for an extra minute or two, until the base is crisp. Lightly drizzle the remaining 20ml oil over the top of the dough and scatter over your toppings of choice (see below for some suggestions). Put the tray on the highest shelf in the oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, rotating it once halfway, until the crust is golden and crisp and the dough thick, fluffy and almost focaccia-like. Scatter over any finishing toppings (see Notes for two suggestions) of your choice, transfer to a board, cut into squares and serve hot.
