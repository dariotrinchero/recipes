# Ingredients

- 2 limes – 1 peeled in 7 long strips, the other grated, to get 1 tsp, then both juiced, to get 1½ tbsp  
- 80g caster sugar  
- 2 large firm peaches, stoned and cut into 0.5cm-thick slices (300g net weight)  
- 2 large sprigs rosemary, plus ½ tbsp picked leaves
- 150g creme fraiche  
- Plain flour, for dusting
- 200g all-butter puff pastry
- 10g unsalted butter, cut into 1cm pieces  
- 1 egg, beaten  
- ¼ tsp cornflour

# Method

1. Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.  
2. Mix the lime juice with 60g sugar in a large bowl, add the peaches, strips of lime skin and rosemary sprigs. Stir and set aside to macerate for at least 40 minutes, and up to a couple of hours. Strain the peaches through a sieve set over a small saucepan, and discard the rosemary and lime peel: you should end up with about 60ml peach syrup.  
3. Mix the grated zest and a teaspoon of sugar into the creme fraiche and refrigerate until ready to serve.  
4. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry into a 26cm-wide circle just under 0.5cm thick, then transfer to a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper.  
5. Arrange the strained peaches haphazardly in the middle of the pastry, leaving a clear 6cm border all around the edge, then fold this outer 6cm rim up and over the peaches. Dot the butter over the exposed peaches, then brush the pastry all over with beaten egg. Sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of sugar evenly over the pastry and bake for 20 minutes, until it’s golden and the filling is beginning to bubble.  
6. While the galette is baking, whisk the cornflour into the reserved peach syrup. Simmer over a medium-high heat until it thickens to the consistency of honey (about two minutes), then pour over the peaches. Sprinkle the rosemary leaves on top and return the galette to the oven for 15 minutes, until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling bubbling.  
7. Leave to cool slightly, then serve with a bowl of the lime creme fraiche on the side.
