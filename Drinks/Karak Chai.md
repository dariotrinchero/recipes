# Ingredients

- 1 1/2 Cup Water (room temp)
- 1 Cup Evaporated Milk
- 2 Tbsp Sugar (use less if you want)
- 3 Tsp Loose Strong Black Tea
- 3-4 g Fresh Ginger
- 4 Green Cardamom pods
- 2 Cloves
- 8 Threads Saffron (optional)
- Piece of cinnamon

# Method

 1. Add the black tea to your pot with the spices. Slice the ginger into strips and add as well
 3. Pour over the room temp water and bring to a boil.
 4. Add the sugar, then reduce heat to medium and allow to simmer for 5 minutes.
 5. When the time is up, add the evaporated milk. DO NOT leave the pot as it will boil over if you do.
 6. Continue to cook over medium-high heat (2-3 minutes) until the Chai comes to a boil
 7. Repeat this 3-5 times to make the texture velvety:
	1. Bring the pot to a boil so the chai foams up
	2. Remove the pot from the stove so that the foam dies down
	3. Once the pot has stopped boiling completely, place this back on the stove
After this, strain the tea and serve it hot or cold
