# Ingredients

## For the dough

- 2.5 Cups (350g) plain (all purpose) flour
- 1 Cup (200ml) water
- 1 Sachet fast action dried bread yeast
- 1 Tablespoon sugar
- 1 Tablespoon oil
- 1 Teaspoon salt

## For the filling

- 1 Onion
- 1 Red bell pepper
- 2 Chillies
- 2 Cloves garlic
- 2 Tomatoes Thyme (fresh or dried)
- Salt to taste
- Oil for frying

# Method

1. Mix all of the dough ingredients, and kneed for about 5min until smooth.
2. Roughly chop all of the ingredients of the filling. Then lightly sweat in oil in a pan, being careful not to brown anything too much.
3. Allow the filling to cool completely while resting the dough (covered) for about 30min, or until doubled in size.
4. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180 Celsius.
5. After the dough is doubled in size, knock it back, and kneed it again. Then divide the dough in two.
6. Roll each half of the dough into a rough rectangle. Spread about half of the cooled filling onto each rolled sheet of dough, leaving a small margin on one of the long sides.
7. Slice each roll of filled dough into 6 pieces.
8. Assemble the pieces next to each other (touching) on a lightly oiled baking tray.
9. Bake for around 20-30min or until lightly golden brown.
10. Optionally brush the baked bread with garlic butter and sprinkle with dried herbs.
