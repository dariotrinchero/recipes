# Ingredients

## Ciabatta (3 small sandwich loaves / 2 regular loaves)

- 350g bread flour
- 280g water
- 10g sachet instant dry yeast
- pinch of salt

## Ciabatta filling (see Ratio by Ruhlman for other ideas)

- head of garlic: top sliced off, drizzled with olive oil, and roasted until golden
- 200g pitted black olives
- large handful rosemary, chopped

## Sandwich sauce (all ingredients to taste)

- mayonnaise (consider [[Mayonnaise (Hellmannâ€™s Copycat)]], or vegan replacement)
- splash lemon juice
- sprinkle of cumin
- generous pinch black pepper
- tiny splash soy sauce

## Sandwich filling (at minimum)

- rosa tomatoes, sliced & salted
- grated cheddar
- generous coating of sandwich sauce on each inner face

# Method

1. Mix bread ingredients until just combined and uniform. Cover loosely in bowl to rest for ~30min.
2. Stretch & fold dough toward centre a few times. Cover & rest for further ~30min. Do this thrice total. Right before the final fold, add optional fillings & fold evenly into dough.
3. Transfer dough onto well-floured surface, roll out & cut, either into 2 or 3 pieces, as desired. Dust (well) with flour & proof for ~45min under plastic film.
4. Shape into rectangle on (greased) baking tray.
5. Slide bread into 230 degree oven, along with dish containing ~1.5-trays-worth of ice. After 10min, reduce heat to 200 degrees, and bake for 12-15min longer.
6. After removing, salt, then allow to cool in order for crust to fully harden. Alternatively, slice now & construct sandwich while soft.
