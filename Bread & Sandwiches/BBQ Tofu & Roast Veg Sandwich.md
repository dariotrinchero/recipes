# Ingredients

## Roast vegetable

- 1 medium aubergine, sliced lengthwise
- 4 baby marrows, sliced into rounds lengthwise

## Salsa (ajvar-inspired)

- 1 red pepper, halved & seeded
- 1 chilli, whole
- handful fresh parsley
- 1 head garlic, decapitated & wrapped in foil
- olive oil
- lemon juice
- salt, pepper, & smoked paprika to taste

## BBQ tofu

- 2 blocks tofu, pressed & sliced into rectangles
- 1/8 cup oil
- 1/8 cup soy sauce
- drizzle of honey
- salt, pepper, & MSG to season
- barbecue sauce

## Sandwich

- Mayonnaise (consider [[Vegan Mayonnaise]])
- 1 avocado, mashed & seasoned (perhaps with some lemon juice added)
- basil or rocket leaves
- 2 bread rolls

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200C, grill. Also get the tofu marinading in the oil, soy sauce, & honey.
2. Lightly brush the vegetable slices with oil, and get these roasting along with the garlic head, red pepper, & chilli.
3. While the vegetables roast, fry the tofu in a nonstick pan. Pour in the excess marinade, and season. Once browned, add some BBQ sauce to taste, and fry until sticky and evenly coated.
4. Warm the rolls in the oven once the vegetables all come out.
5. Once nicely blackened, peel the excess red pepper skin, then blend the salsa ingredients in a food processor. One can optionally add some mayo to achieve something more like a Marie Rose sauce, and to mellow the chilli heat.
6. Slice the rolls, and spread both sides with mayonnaise. Then apply mashed avocado to one side and salsa to the other. Finally, spread the vegetables, basil leaves, and tofu out across the rolls.

# Notes

- Obviously, many remixes of this are possible, but the base version surpasses the sum of its parts to a surprising degree - it's easily a 9/10 sandwich.
- For rolls, I like using mini sourdough baguettes, if available.
