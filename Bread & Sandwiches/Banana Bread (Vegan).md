# Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons (90 mL) aquafaba
- 3 medium-sized _very ripe_ bananas (~ 300g without peels), plus 1 optional ripe banana for decoration
- 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons (90 mL) oat milk
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/3 cup (75g) neutral oil
- 3/4 cup (115g) brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour, spooned & levelled
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 176°C. Arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Line a 9×5-inch (23×13 cm) loaf pan with parchment paper, letting the excess hang over the long sides to form a sling.
2. Pour the aquafaba into a medium bowl. Using a handheld electric mixer, whip the aquafaba on medium speed for 45-60 seconds until uniformly foamy.
3. Wipe out the bowl used for the aquafaba. Add the three bananas to the bowl and mash with a fork until smooth and no lumps remain (or, for a more rustic banana bread, leave a few chunks in).
4. Stir the lemon juice into the oat milk and set aside. This is the vegan "buttermilk."
5. In a large mixing bowl, add the sugar and oil. Whisk until well combined. Add the whipped aquafaba and mix until well incorporated. Add in the vegan "buttermilk" and vanilla and mix until smooth. Add the mashed bananas and mix until well incorporated.
7. Add the flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon to the wet ingredients. Switch to using a silicone spatula, & gently stir until the ingredients are just barely combined. It’s okay if you can see a few traces of flour.
8. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out the top of the batter using a spatula or spoon.
9. For the optional decoration, keep the peel on the reserved banana and slice it in half, lengthwise; then peel the banana. Sprinkle a little coconut sugar or brown sugar on the cut/interior sides of the banana. Gently arrange the bananas on top the batter, sugared side side up.
10. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted into the centre top **at a slight angle** comes out a few moist crumbs.
11. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. Then remove the bread from the pan and cool on the rack for at least 20 to 30 minutes before slicing (the bread is still cooking and setting up, so don't slice too early).

# Notes

- Optionally add some extra spices like clove and nutmeg.
