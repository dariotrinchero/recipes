# Ingredients

- 2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
- 4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 3 medium onions, one finely chopped (about 1 cup) and the other two sliced for caramelisation
- 1 large red pepper, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
- 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 1 large jalapeno chilli, finely chopped, plus 1 teaspoon smoky hot sauce
- 3/4 cup roasted cashews
- 1/2 cup finely crumbled feta
- 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise (consider [[Mayonnaise (Hellmann’s Copycat)]])
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Cheese for topping, such as pepper jack, cheddar, muenster, or Swiss (optional)
- 6 to 8 hearty hamburger buns, toasted
- Condiments as desired, such as chipotle mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise
- Toppings as desired, such as shredded lettuce, sliced onions, and pickles

# Method

1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread black beans in a single layer on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Roast until beans are mostly split open and outer skins are beginning to get crunchy, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.
2. While beans roast, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chilli and sauce and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
3. Caramelise the remaining two onions caramelising in some oil.
4. Place cashews in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until chopped into pieces no larger than 1/3-inch, about 12 short pulses. Add to bowl with onions and peppers.
5. When beans are slightly cooled, transfer to food processor. Add cheese. Pulse until beans are roughly chopped (the largest pieces should be about 1/3 of a full bean in size). Transfer to bowl with onion/pepper mixture. Add caramelised onions. Add bread crumbs, egg, and mayonnaise and season with salt and pepper. Fold together gently but thoroughly with hands. Patty mixture can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days at this stage.
6. **To cook indoors:** Form bean mixture into 6 to 8 patties as wide as your burger buns. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add 4 patties and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until well browned and crisp on first side, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until second side is browned, about 5 minutes longer, adding cheese if desired. If cooking more than 4 burgers, cook in batches, keeping cooked burgers on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a 200°F oven while second batch cooks.
7. Spread top and bottom buns with chipotle mayonnaise or other condiments as desired. Add toppings to top or bottom bun as desired. Place patties on bottom buns, close burgers, and serve immediately.

# Notes

- Caramelised onions are my own modification to the original recipe. They significantly improve the flavour and structural integrity.
