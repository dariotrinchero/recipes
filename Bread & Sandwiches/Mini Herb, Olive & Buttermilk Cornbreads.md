# Ingredients

- 25g melted butter, plus extra for greasing
- 200g plain flour
- 100g cornmeal, or polenta
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 284ml buttermilk
- 2 eggs, beaten with a fork
- 75g gruyère, grated
- 50g pitted green olives, roughly chopped
- finely chopped herbs to make 4 tbsp (such as rosemary, basil, mixed herbs, parsley, or dill)

# Method

1. Heat the oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 and butter the mini loaf tins. Mix the flour, polenta, baking powder, salt and sugar. In another bowl or jug, whisk the buttermilk, eggs and butter with 1 tbsp water, then stir this into the dry ingredients until well mixed. Add most of the grated gruyère, chopped olives and herbs and fold through.
2. Divide the mixture between the loaf tins and scatter with the remaining cheese, olives and herbs.
3. Bake the loaves for 20 minutes, or until golden and risen (if using the larger tins they may need 22). Check with a skewer – they’re done when it comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tins for 15 minutes, then carefully turn out and cool on a wire rack, or eat with extra butter while still oven warm.
