# Ingredients

## Cooked lentils

- 1 cup black lentils
- 1 cup mixed orange & brown lentils (~ 2/3 brown, 1/3 orange)
- herbs & spices, _ad lib_; consider
    - soy sauce, vegetable stock
    - cumin, coriander
    - onion & garlic powder
    - dried thyme & oregano
    - MSG, salt, pepper
- 1 white onion, roughly diced
- 3 large cloves of garlic, minced

## Patties

- cooked lentils, as above
- 6-7 egg whites
- ~1+1/4 cup fine bread crumbs, plus a little more by eye
- 3 white onions, sliced root-to-tip
- olive oil

## Burger sauce (all ingredients to taste)

- mayonnaise (consider [[Mayonnaise (Hellmannâ€™s Copycat)]] or [[Vegan Mayonnaise]])
- sriracha
- mustard, wholegrain & Dijon
- soy sauce
- onion & garlic powder

## Burgers

- burger buns
- greens of choice (rocket recommended)
- cheese of choice
- tomato
- red onions, pickled or raw

# Method

1. Cook lentils in minimal water. Mixture should be cooked through and slightly pasty once all excess water has cooked off. Microwave for ~6min to drive off some more water. Allow to cool.
2. Caramelise 3 onions while the lentils cook & cool. Drain of excess oil.
3. Mix lentils with egg whites, then slowly add bread crumbs until mixture is moist and tacky, but holds together. Mix in caramelised onions.
4. Form into patties & bake (on parchment + non-stick covering such as Spray & Cook) at 170 degrees for around 10-15min, until largely structurally sound (you should be able to gently handle complete patty with hands). Do not over-bake, or pressing patties down in pan becomes largely impossible.
5. Fry patties in oil over high heat in a stainless-steel skillet, until exterior is charred & crispy. Baste while frying, and flip once. Add layers of cheese on top after first flip, then stack second fried patty on top of cheese.
6. Toast buns face-down in butter over high heat.
7. Assemble burger, using sauce to hold ingredients together.

# Notes

- Try adding caramelised onion to this. See [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/w2u048/i_finally_made_a_veggie_burger_that_doesnt_fall/).
- Despite my best efforts, these are probably not as good as J Kenji Lopez Alt's [[Really Awesome Black Bean Burgers]].
