# Ingredients

- 8 garlic cloves cut through, to rub the bowl
- 4 each red, yellow and green capsicum
- 48 baby Roma tomatoes, halved
- 8 slim spring onions, finely chopped
- 4 cups of chopped or crumbled feta
- Handful of fresh basil leaves, torn

## Dressing

- 12 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
- 4 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
- 4 teaspoons Tamari soy sauce
- 4 tablespoons ponzu
- 8 tablespoons finely chopped sushi ginger
- Black pepper to taste

# Method

1. Slice right through two connected garlic cloves (i.e. stuck together) and rub the inside of the bowl all over vigorously.
2. Separate the capsicums in their natural sections (follow the spines as it were) and remove all the unwanted bits and pieces. Slice into thin strips. Place them around the bowl, in unison.
3. Top them with halved baby Roma tomatoes and sprinkle finely chopped spring onion over.
4. In a small bowl, mix the crumbled or chopped feta with the torn basil and spoon it into the centre of the salad.
5. Mix the dressing ingredients in a bowl and drizzle it all over the salad. Drizzle some extra ponzu sauce around the exposed parts of the peppers.

# Notes

- Made by Linda at a Christmas lunch. The ponzu sauce is the real star of the show here, making for a rather surprising flavour combination.
