# Ingredients

- 200g stale bread, torn into chunks
- 2 yellow peppers
- 750g really ripe rosa tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 red onion, finely sliced
- 1 small jar of capers, or a generous handful, drained
- 1 bunch of basil, washed & torn

## Dressing

- 100ml olive oil
- 30ml balsamic vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- salt and pepper

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 250 Celsius. If your bread is not quite stale (or just for a little extra crispness), tear it into bite-sized chunks, spread them out on a baking sheet, and pop it into the oven when you first turn it on. Take it out when the oven reaches temperature, or when the bread has dried out.
2. When the oven is hot, char the two peppers on the top shelf for ~15min. Remove and wrap in tin foil to steam.
3. Salt the tomatoes and drain them in a sieve. You can keep the tomato juice to add to the dressing, optionally.
4. Prepare the dressing.
5. Peel the peppers, and slice into strips once cool.
6. Finally, combine all the ingredients, toss the salad, and allow it to sit for at least 30min further for flavours to fully develop.
