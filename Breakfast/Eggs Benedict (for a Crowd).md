# Ingredients

- 1-12 English muffin halves (separate with a fork)
- 1-12 eggs
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Chives or cayenne pepper, as garnish
- **Optional toppings**: spinach, imitation bacon, etc.

## For Hollandaise (makes 1 cup; scale as needed)

- 2 large egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon (5ml) water
- 1 teaspoon (5ml) lemon juice from 1 lemon
- Kosher salt
- 1 stick (113g) unsalted butter
- Pinch cayenne pepper or hot sauce, optional

# Method

## Pre-poaching eggs (see notes)

1. Carefully break the eggs into a bowl. Set a fine mesh strainer over a second bowl. Carefully tip the eggs into the strainer and swirl gently to let all the excess loose whites drain out into the second bowl. When the eggs are thoroughly drained, transfer them back to the first bowl.
2. Bring a few inches of salted water in a wide saucepan to a simmer. Reduce heat until it’s at the gentlest simmer (a few bubbles should be leaving the bottom of the pot in a steady stream). It should register around 190°F (90°C) on a thermometer. Swirl the water gently with a slotted spoon. Gently tip the eggs into the water. Keep stirring gently to keep the eggs moving around the bottom of the pan. Flip them occasionally to ensure even cooking.
3. Cook until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still liquid, about 3 minutes. Carefully lift eggs from the pot with a slotted or perforated spoon. Transfer to a bowl of ice water.

## Fool-proof Hollandaise

1. Combine the egg yolks, water, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in a cup or jar that's just wide enough to accommodate the head of your hand blender.
2. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat, swirling constantly, until foamy and bubbling. Transfer the butter to a liquid measuring cup, **leaving behind any milky white liquid** at the bottom.  
3. Place head of immersion blender into the bottom of the cup and turn it on. With the blender constantly running, slowly pour the hot butter into the measuring up, letting it run down the shaft of the hand blender. Continue pouring slowly until all the butter is added. The Hollandaise should be thick and creamy. Season to taste with salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper or hot sauce, as desired. You can adjust the consistency of the sauce with a little bit of water if you prefer it thinner. It should flow very gently like lava when you spoon it onto a plate.
4. Place the blender jar in a hot water bath and keep it in a warm place for up to 30 minutes before serving.

## Assembly

1. Toast the English muffin halves in a toaster or under the broiler until browned and crusty.
2. Meanwhile fry imitation bacon, blanch spinach, or otherwise prepare other optional toppings.
3. Remove Hollandaise from warm water bath, and add eggs directly to the same bath to reheat.
4. Arrange the English muffin halves on a serving platter, split-side-up. Carefully lift the poached eggs out of the water bath with a slotted spoon, allowing excess water to drain off, then place on top of each muffin half. Season the eggs with salt and pepper. Spoon the Hollandaise over the top, making sure it coats each egg completely. Garnish with chives or cayenne pepper. Serve immediately.

# Notes

- Pre-poached eggs can be stored in an airtight container covered in cold water in the fridge for up to **two days**, and can thus be made **well** in advance.
- Leftover Hollandaise can't be reheated.
