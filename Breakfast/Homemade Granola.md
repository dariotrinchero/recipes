# Ingredients

## Master Recipe

- 1 tsp extract (almond, vanilla, etc)
- ¼ cup seeds
- 2 cups rolled oats
- ½ - 1 cup nuts (This is the most expensive item, so it's flexible)
- ¼ tsp salt

## Variation: almond-lover

- ¼ cup chia seeds

- ½ - 1 cup almonds
- ½ tsp salt

## Variation: banana bread

- ¼ cup syrup
- 3 super-ripe mashed bananas
- 1 tbsp dark rum
- ¼ cup pumpkin seeds
- 2 cups rolled oats
- ½ - 1 cup walnuts
- ½ tsp salt

## Also consider

- Gingerbread Spices & Crystallized Ginger
- Chai Spice & Maple Syrup

# Method

1. Mix the wet ingredients like nut butter, extract, etc, first.
2. Mix in the dry ingredients and stir until some clumps form.
3. Bake in a 350F oven for between 20 and 45min. Check in and remove once oats are lightly golden.
4. **Allow to cool completely!**. This allows granola to clump more before we disturb it.

# Notes

- Using honey as the sweetener works best for clumping.
- One can also fold a frothed egg white into the other ingredients before baking to increase cluster formation to taste.
