# Method

1. Cut the Halloumi cheese into cubes and put them in a bowl. Pour enough water to completely cover the cheese, and soak it for 20 minutes to reduce the saltiness and change the texture of the cheese. When it's ready, remove it from the water and mix it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, paprika, and turmeric.
2. For the sauce, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Add cumin, coriander, and caraway seeds and cook until fragrant, then add sliced garlic and diced onion. Cook until the onions are softened, then add paprika and harissa paste. Cook for another minute and add chopped tomatoes, honey, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. If the sauce seems too thick, add water. Cook for 10 minutes.
3. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 220°C fan and prepare the vegetables for roasting. Place the diced aubergine in a bowl and marinate it with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, honey, salt, and Ras el Hanout spice blend. Mix well, then add peppers and onions and mix again. The aubergine's spongy texture will soak up all the flavours. Place the vegetables on a tray and roast in the oven for around 20 minutes (Don't overcrowd the vegetables on the roasting tray. Spread them out in a single layer so that they cook evenly and roast to perfection, use two trays if necessary).
4. When the sauce is ready, you can blend it or leave it as is. Transfer it to a cast iron pan or other baking dish, add the roasted vegetables to the sauce, and top with the halloumi cheese. Place it in the oven and change the setting to the 220°C grill. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until the halloumi cheese starts to brown (Be careful not to overcook the Halloumi cheese. It only needs a few minutes under the grill to brown and become crispy. Keep an eye on it and remove it from the oven as soon as it reaches your desired level of doneness).
5. Remove from the oven, garnish with parsley or cilantro, and enjoy with your favourite flatbread! Enjoy!
