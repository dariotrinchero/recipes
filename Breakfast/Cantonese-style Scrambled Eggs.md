# Ingredients

- 5 medium eggs
- Seasoning for the eggs:
	- 1/2 tsp salt,
	- 1/2 tsp sugar,
	- a slurry of 1 tsp cornstarch (生粉) mixed with 1 tbsp water,
	- optional 1/2 tsp liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒/绍酒),
	- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil (麻油),
	- 1/8 tsp white pepper powder (白胡椒粉),
	- 1/8 tsp MSG or chicken bouillon powder (味精/鸡粉).
- Oil, for frying, 2 tbsp
- Add-ins (optional):
	- ~60g; Jiuhuang yellow chives (韭黄),
	- ~20g or the white portion of, I dunno, ~4 scallions

# Method

1. Optional: separate the whites and yolks, whisk the whites until large bubbles start to form.
2. If using any add-ins, cook your add ins. For us, we toasted the Chinese yellow chives for 2 minutes in a dry wok (note: Chinese yellow chives are very different from Western chives, do not toast your western chives for two minutes).
3. Once you're almost ready to fry, add the whites back to the yolks. Whisk again. If you did not separate the eggs, whisk for ~1 minute or until you start to see big bubbles.
4. Add in the seasoning. Quick whisk.
5. If you have any add-ins, add the add-ins. Quickly combine.
6. Fry according to the method in the video.
