# Ingredients

## For kadai masala

- 2 tablespoons coriander seeds
- 1 to 2 Kashmiri dried red chillies
- 2 to 3 green cardamoms
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
- 2 cloves
- ¼ inch cinnamon (Ceylon, not cassia)

## To saute & puree

- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1 cup (125g) onions, sliced or diced (1 large)
- 1½ to 2 cups (300g) tomatoes, chopped (2 large or 3 medium)
- 6 cashew nuts (can substitute with 3 tbsp cream)

## Other ingredients

- 1 to 1½ tablespoon oil or ghee (divided ½ + ½)
- 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
- ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder (adjust to taste)
- ½ teaspoon garam masala (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon kasuri methi
- ½ to ¾ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
- 1½ to 2 cups water for gravy
- 1 medium onion, cubed & separated into layers (optional)
- ½ cup bell pepper, cubed
- 200-250g paneer (use tofu to make vegan)
- ½ to 1 teaspoon ginger, julienned
- 2 tablespoons coriander leaves, chopped finely

# Method

1. Grind red chillies, cardamom, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, cloves & cinnamon to a fine powder. If you add more cinnamon it can ruin the dish.
2. Heat oil in a pan. Add onions & cashew nuts. Saute them on a medium high flame until the onions turn transparent or pink.
3. Add tomatoes and saute until completely mushy. 
4. Cool this completely and add to a blender jar. Blend to a smooth paste or puree. Set this aside.
5. To the same pan, add oil and heat it.
6. Saute onion and capsicum on the highest flame until half done. They must be slightly tender yet crunchy.
7. Add paneer and toss for 1 to 2 mins. Set all these aside. Do not over fry these.
8. Heat the rest of the oil and saute ginger garlic paste until the raw smell goes off.
9. Next transfer the ground kadai masala (from step 1) and saute on a low to medium heat for 2 to 3 mins until it turns fragrant. Do not burn.
10. Add the ground onion tomato paste (from step 4) and saute for 2 mins.
11. Next add garam masala and red chilli powder. Saute for another 2 mins until the masala turns fragrant.
12. Pour 1 cup water and salt. If you feel the gravy is too thick, pour ¼ to ½ cup more water. Allow it to boil until the gravy thickens and traces of oil appear on top.
13. Then crush and add kasuri methi. Stir well again. Taste the gravy and add more salt or garam masala as needed.
14. Add the sauteed paneer, capsicum and onion.
15. Stir well & finally add julienned ginger and coriander leaves.
16. Cover and rest for 2 mins. Transfer to a serving bowl and rest for at least 15 mins for the paneer to absorb the flavours.
