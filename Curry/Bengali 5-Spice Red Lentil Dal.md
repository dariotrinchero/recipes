# Ingredients

- 1 cup red lentils (yellow lentils will work as well)
- 3 cups water
- 3 plum tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1/2 cup finely chopped white or yellow onion
- 2 medium cloves garlic, finely chopped and made into a paste
- 2 teaspoons Bengali five spice mix (panch phoron) OR
	- 1/2 teaspoon nigella seeds (or black/white sesame seeds),
	- 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds,
	- 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds,
	- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds, and
	- 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt plus more to taste
- 1 lime, juiced (about 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice)
- 8 sprigs cilantro, de-stemmed and chopped
- Cooked basmati rice, optional

# Method

1. **Cook the lentils**: Place 1 cup of red lentils in a metal sieve. Rinse well with cold water. Pour cleaned lentils into a medium sauce pan. Add 3 cups of water. Bring lentils and water to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until the lentils are soft.
2. **Blanch and chop the tomatoes**: Score the peel of the tomatoes with a sharp knife in the shape of an "X". Place the tomatoes in boiling water and blanch for one minute. Peel and chop.
3. **Sauté the onions with seasonings**: After the lentils in step 1 have cooked at least 5 minutes, start preparing the onions and spices.
   In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions. Cook until translucent, about 3 minutes.
   Add garlic paste and cook for 1 minute more, stirring continuously, making sure that the garlic does not burn. Add the Bengali five spice. Cook and stir for another 2-3 minutes. Add bay leaf and turmeric. Stir.
4. Add the cooked lentils, salt, and simmer for 10min more.
5. Add lime juice and tomatoes. Cook for 3-5 more minutes. Adjust salt if necessary. Stir in chopped cilantro and remove from heat. Garnish with more chopped cilantro. Serve with basmati rice or naan bread.

# Notes

- Relative to other dal recipes (such as [[Middle Eastern Red Lentil Soup]]), this is quite a mild flavour.
