# Ingredients

- ½ kg (1 lb) potatoes (or 25 small baby potatoes)
- 1¼ cup (230 grams) onions cubed (2 medium)
- 1 cup (180 grams) tomatoes chopped (2 medium)
- 12 cashew nuts or almonds
- 2 to 3 tablespoon oil
- 1 green chilli chopped (optional)
- 1 teaspoon ginger garlic paste (or 1 inch ginger & 3 garlic cloves finely minced)
- ¾ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
- ¾ to 1 teaspoon sugar to balance the flavors
- ¼ cup curd (plain yogurt) (refer notes)
- 1 tablespoon coriander leaves finely chopped for garnish

## Spices

- 1 bay leaf (very small or half)
- 2 green cardamom
- 1 teaspoon garam masala (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon coriander powder
- ¾ to 1 teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder (low heat kind, or paprika)
- ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
- ¼ teaspoon fennel seeds powder (optional, but recommended)
- 1 teaspoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)

# Method

1. Wash and peel potatoes. If using large potatoes, then cube them to equal size about 1½ inch each. If using baby potatoes make sure all are of the same size.
2. Bring 3 to 4 cups of water to a rolling boil in a pot. Then add the potatoes. Boil them until they are half cooked. To check, prick them with a fork, you will feel them hard but not very hard. Remove them from water with a slotted spoon. Set aside to cool & dry.
3. **This step is optional but gives a good texture to the potatoes**. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a non-stick pan. Add the potatoes and shallow fry them on a medium high flame until golden. Remove them to a plate.
4. Prick each aloo with a fork 3 times so it absorbs the flavors of the gravy. Ensure you don't overdo this and break them.
5. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil and add onions to it. Boil for 6 to 8 minutes until they turn pale and transparent. Drain them completely & rinse with cold water. Drain again.
6. Add them to a blender jar along with cashews and tomatoes. Make a smooth puree. If you do not have a powerful blender, then filter the puree. Keep this aside.
7. Heat a pan with 2 tablespoons oil. Add bay leaf and cardamom. Then add ginger garlic paste & fry until the raw smell goes away.
8. Add the onion tomato paste and saute until the raw smell goes away and the paste thickens slightly. Next add chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder, salt, fennel seeds powder, sugar and turmeric.
10. Saute until the masala becomes thick, smells good and aromatic. (check step-by-step photos above)
11. Meanwhile, whisk yogurt in a small bowl until smooth. Then add 2 tablespoons of the onion tomato masala to the whisked yogurt. Mix it well and add back to the pan.
12. Saute until the masala turns thicker. Add potatoes and pour ½ cup water. Stir well to make a gravy. If needed add more water as required. Bring the gravy to a boil.
13. Cover with a tight lid or foil. Dum cook on a low heat for 5 to 7 minutes. At this stage the gravy must be thick and potatoes fully cooked.
14. Sprinkle crushed kasuri methi. Taste test and add more salt if needed. Turn off. Lastly sprinkle coriander leaves and transfer dum aloo to a serving bowl. Keep covered until dum aloo is served.
16. Serve it with basmati rice, roti, butter naan or even with flavored rice like jeera rice, ghee rice or pulao.

# Notes

- Avoid using sour tasting yogurt as it makes the gravy sour. If you do not eat yogurt then you may replace it with another 8 cashews or almonds.
- Do not reduce the spices in the curry as it really helps to balance the tang from the yogurt.
