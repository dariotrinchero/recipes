- 3 potatoes (432 g), cubed
- 1 Tbsp ginger, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- ½ apple (170 g), grated
- freshly ground black pepper

## For Japanese curry roux (makes some excess)

#### Spice mix

- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp ginger powder
- 1 tsp ground black (or white) pepper
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ground fenugreek
- 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves

#### Roux ingredients

- 3-4 Tbsp neutral oil
- 3-4 Tbsp flour
- 1 tsp sugar
- Soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce to taste

## For curry sauce

- 1½ Tbsp olive oil
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 Tbsp honey (or sugar)
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp tomato paste

# Method

## Japanese curry roux

1. Make a dark blonde roux.
2. Whisk in the spices.
3. Slowly add cold water while whisking continuously. Add a (generous) splash of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Adjust to taste.

## Curry

1. Fry onion wedges in olive oil. Allow them to develop some colour. Pour off excess oil & set aside.
2. Add garlic & ginger paste. Fry a while longer, then add stock.
3. Add tomato paste, grated apple, honey (or sugar), soy sauce, and the chopped carrots and potatoes.
4. Boil, covered, until vegetables are soft.
5. Stir in curry roux, a little at a time, to taste. Adjust seasoning as needed.
6. Serve over rice, or with bread.

# Notes

- Curry roux freezes really well. Make a double batch and keep for future curries!
